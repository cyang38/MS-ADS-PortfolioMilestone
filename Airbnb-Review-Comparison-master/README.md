# Airbnb-Review-Comparison
This is an academic project on Airbnb reviews in New York city.

The dataset is the reviews that Airbnb users left when they finished a reservation. 
I analyzed the top 200 active listings and reviews, and also subset the groups with the ratings that are 
lower than 85 (100-scale) and see the difference among them. Active listings mean they have 
average 8+ reviews per months, and ratings are over 93.
