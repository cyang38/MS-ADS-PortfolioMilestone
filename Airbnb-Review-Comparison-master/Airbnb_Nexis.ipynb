There are a number of grocery stores, gas stations, and coffee shops (dd & s-bucks), pharmacies, and convenience stores in the vicinity. The NYSC on 145 & Fred. Douglas is a good place to work out. The neighborhood looks rough on first site, but the people are all very kind and I felt safe there. The stairwell to the building is rather filthy and smells, but the apartment is very clean with comfy beds. Would definitely stay here again. This was a great experience.\\n'"

       "'The host canceled this reservation 13 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. The location and the communication with the host were great the only issue I encounter it was the sleeping situation eventhough the host did help me with everything Jack is a great host.  Makes sure you have everything you need from check-in to check-out.  His apartment is in a great midtown location.  I would stay there again. Ok yes. I really like the location of  house and it’s very convenient. And the house is very clean. He is a very nice host. Almost everything is good. The only thing little bother me is just the noise from outside like car or bird something. Anyway Five Stars hahahah I had a nice trip in this place Dirty, unclean, and very outdated/rundown. Apart from location  there is NOTHING nice about this place. I forgot to mention in my review its 4 flights up stairs up no elevator. Thus not suitable for disabled or people who struggle to walk up stairs (esp with luggage).\\n\\nThis place is a very deep clean and for the host to actually clean the place to be respectable by guests. Things like dental floss on the counter, razor with hair in the bathroom, rubbish in the trash can, and cups/clothes, left over takeaway. Very, very disappointing. It worked out cheaper & cleaner to go to a hotel 2 streets away. Space is SHARED, and private room isn\\'t that private. Jack was a great host and his place is perfect location and price for me If you are looking for a place right in the heart of the city, Jack’s place is the perfect fit!  We were walking distance from Time Square, all the way down to Flat Iron District.  Jack is very responsive and overall a great host.  Would definitely stay again. Easy going host. Brilliant locations, no frills but perfect for the price. Well priced place to stay in downtown NYC. Taz as a person and host was great, very friendly, quick to respond to questions, and very knowledgeable about the area.  As a newbie to NY his knowledge was very appreciated. \\n\\nYet here is what I experienced on my 3-day stay. You are sharing the living quarters with other Airbnb guest(s) daily. Be warned because I was woken up several times daily between 12-3am with the other guests coming in and out of the apartment and they have to cross the living room to get to the only bedroom in the apartment. \\n\\nSafety of your valuables and/or luggage is not secure since you are in the living room of a small 1-bedroom apartment with other guests you don’t know. Privacy is very minimal.\\n\\nApartment is on the 4th floor! So if you brought luggage plan on hauling it up and down a narrow set of stairs.\\n\\nOverall, Good deal for the price of a bed in a living room in this area. I recommend renting out the whole place or the bedroom. Unless you are on a tight budget and just need a place to crash for cheap. Taz is Cool! Always prompt and made sure I was set from Check In to Check Out. Quite a nice place. The location is great. Taz responds fastly. There were two beds in one room and another room with a double bed for two. If you are going to be in the city all day long as me and just sleep at the apartment you will love it.. Great location, very clean and the host is always there when we needed. Im very happy for this choice. If I come back to NYC, I want to stay at Taz again! The apartment was very clean and the host was very responsive to messages. Location was perfect, less than 5 minutes walk to the subway and times square . Host is not at all reachable all throughout your stay as he does not lives in new york. Hence expect no commincation over call with him. Be aware that you will be sharing the same room with a stranger, his bed being 1,5 mtr away, and that another stranger will cross your room to go into his room, will probably turn on the ceiling light when he comes, that the bathroom will be as clean as the other guys will let it since Taz doesn\\'t show up, terrible experience for me... beside that the location is ideal The location is in timesquare, which is perfect if you wanna go out early and come home late at night to and from roaming around NYC. The host is awesome, he is very patient to respond to each and every queries I had so my stay will be as smooth as possible. Although, the bulding has no elevator, so if you have a heavy luggages, you have to carry them through the stairs. Otherwise, everything was good. This was my first time staying in a shared apartment and it ended up being a great experience. Excellent location, exactly what i needed for only being at the room to shower/sleep. Apartment was quiet and other guests respectful. Would definitely recommend as it is much more affordable than anything else around the city. Taz was extremely responsive and gave me perfect logistics advice for free parking quick public transportation to the apartment. Very affordable place right next to Times Square. Excellent if you just need to crash for a night or two with the bare minimum. You get what you pay for. No lock for your valuables FYI. Centrally located, Good place if you are looking for a shared space in heart of manhattan. Taz was very nice and responsive. The place is extremely well situated, which makes its interest. Yet, it is very small and we were 4 people in there (all unknown to each other). The beds weren\\'t ready when I arrived (around 5pm), and above all, the place was dirty (the bathroom in particular was extremely dirty). So I recommend it if you have no other choice, but I stayed one night and wouldn\\'t want to stay another one in such an unclean environment. Needs to be more accurate with description The place is very good location.You can trip by walking the Times Square and the house very nice great location  What a truly horrible experience This was an absolutely terrible experience. Do not stay here. The location of the apartment is very convenient. However, the bathroom was absolutely disgusting with hair and urine all over the place as soon as I arrived. The host added another bed to the living room. You already have little to no privacy, which is something I was ready to deal with. However, with the additional bed you might as well be staying in a hostel. Very misleading representation of the unit.  El alojamiento de Taz tiene una excelente ubicación y comodidades básicas para una estadía corta a muy buen precio. La coordinación para la llegada y la salida fue muy buena y Taz siempre respondió con rapidez mis consultas. This place is prime if you are looking for an inexpensive place to crash right in the heart of everything. I was in New York for a night due to some flight cancellations and just needed a place for an evening while taking in some shows. Taz was great with communication and it was easy to get in. It is a fourth floor walk up so just keep that in mind if you do have a lot of luggage. Just know that you are sharing space with others but it wasn’t a big deal for the short time that I was there. Don’t know that I would stay here for a long period of time but it was perfect for the time that I was there. I would fully recommend this to anybody who’s looking for an inexpensive place to stay right in the heart of Hells kitchen. I felt completely safe and was not worried about any of my belongings. It’s a multi-bed apartment Great location and price! It’s a bunch of stairs only to be disappointed \\nWorst experience, dirty sheets, unresponsive host\\nI didn’t even stay, I left almost immediately  It was a quick stay. I was in the apartment only for one night, but everything went fine. Communication was fast and efficient. A good place to stay in NYC if you are travelling alone. Fair price for a place near Times Square. Great experience. Convient.  You should not book this place for more than a night. The location is great and so is the hosts willingness to communicate. The praise stops there. The place is disgusting. It is unsanitary. When I arrived I noticed that the sheets were dirty. It had hair follicles all over the sheets. Then there was dust all over the house. Then there’s the towels. Tax’s towels are disgusting. It looks as if he throws the towels in the closet and never washes them. It had stains on them and smelled absolutely disgusting. Beware that this place is not as seen. the room was ok, the toilet dirty, location good Amazing location conforme a la description, confortable, connexion internet et excellente localisation et le propriétaire est réactif aux messages\\n I arrive at 7 am. I steady spoken to the host about being in later and asked if I could extend my stay half day. No response. I arrive in the unit and the sheets are dirty with hair bugs and stains. I kept calling to get clarity on clean sheets and towel. The other people staying in unit also had a hard time with cleanliness but didn’t speak English very well. Finally Taz calls me and is saying allow a cleaning guy to change sheets in 1 hour. I sleep by 8:30 am. I wake up at 2:30 pm to someone yelling at me from within. He kept saying “You need to leave.” Very rude and kept pressuring me. When I asked about a clean towel he rudely says “This isn’t a hotel!” Okay... so I call Taz again and he asks to speak to this Cleaning guy and tells me please let him change the bed for next person. He finally does and leaves. Taz texts me saying I could take a shower and stay —- just after he said “You need to leave.” I take a shower and dried off with paper towels.... the shower has not been cleaned there’s a big hunk of hair and dirt. I noticed before leaving the “cleaning guy” left my dirty sheets on the bed and used same DIRTY blanket with bugs. Taz claimed the sheets were cleaned. See pictures.  Great service and place.  will get the job done for a night Good quick little stay. Zero problems.  incredible Je déconseille fortement ce logement. A l’arrivée j’ai trouvé des draps sales, un lit non fait, une salle de bain sale.\\nL’hôte n’a pas mis toutes les informations.\\nUne personne est passée pour faire le ménage mais ça s’est juste limité à changer les draps.  Blah Taz is a very helpful, responsive host. The value of the stay is decent too. One of the cheapest places on Manhattan Taz was an excellent host! He asked and helped me how to get there! It was an excellent place to stay! Hi! The accommodation is perfectly located for a traveller. You can have breakfast, lunch, dinner at only 5min walk away. The space is really small, but if you choose to rent it only for the bed and the bathroom, the price is the best you can get in this area. Best location if your looking to stay in Time Square, any hotel will run you $200+ easily. I’m pretty easy going but this is still a service you pay for. The bed was not made when I arrived. I informed the host and they had someone come to the apartment, I then was instructed to go to the closet and get the sheets and make the bed myself. The bathroom is also not the cleanest and has mold in the tub plus missing tiles. Perfect location to crash for a night while exploring NY Excellent location, next to Time square.

The location was nice! Very close to Time Square. However, I would say you get what you pay. Everything was nice and without any troubles. Location is perfect It was hard to find the keys, no instruction, no air conditioner. Si planeas estar fuera y solo buscas lugar para dormir y bañarte... Este es el lugar perfecto. Buena ubicación y precio. Taz was great. Everything was clean and organized. He was there when I needed him for assistance. I was a little nervous to find the lockbox because I arrived late, but it wasn’t as bad as I thought. It was actually really easy. There’s also security( a camera that watches the front door), which made me feel a little bit safer considering I was traveling alone and staying with complete strangers. Location was great—smack dab in the middle of everything but also kind of secluded. The only problem I had was the other guest, but it is what it is. I was only in town for 12 hours. Just needed a bed for the night, but the time I spend in the room was fine. Blanket, sheets, and towel seemed clean and were neatly folded when I arrived. Place overall seemed clean. Nothing bad to say over here. As mentioned in the description: there are two beds in one room, just separated by a folding screen. The neighbours i had were rather silent. However the room is also the corridor in a second room (withe double bed), and therefore people living there walk by the bed. Wearing shoes this is noisy and dirty. The bathroom is shared by all four people. Muy bueno el lugar para el que quiera recorrer NY, la estación de colectivos y trenes está a la vuelta, te permite llegar al aeropuerto, a los buses, a los subtes, con mucha facilidad para recorrer económicamente NY. A 2 cuadras de time square, todo cerca. No tiene muchas comodidades pero no se necesita más para quien busca dormir y bañarse. Muy buena la atención de taz Taz was very reliable and he responds rapidly. Location was PERFECT.  Will definitely be staying again Great location and smooth process Taz\\'s place was great! Quick and convenient, thank you so much. Good Good place for a short stay Fast communication Do yourself a favor and get and airbnb somewhere else. I felt like I was experiencing what NY used to be like back in the day. On cold nights, not having a heater will make you sleep with both your sweater and a coat, since the blankets are pretty thin. The big lock you get your keys from at the check in might get stuck in the rain. I picked this place, because it said washer and dryer are (in-unit). They are in the basement (this apt. is on the 4th floor w no elevator), and you have to call Taz to let you in. It will not be convenient. I ended up washing my clothes by hand and drying them on the room divider screen by the bed. I wasn\\'t very happy to be doing that. There is no place to put your clothes or anything by the way, not even a coat rack or a drawer. Also, the light weight screen keeps collapsing. The other guest\\'s bed and the screen are right next to you screen, so the guests that stayed in the other bed also had their screen collapsing over my screen. When the screen is open a little wider to just get into your bed or to prevent the screen from collapsing all the time, it gets difficult for the people staying in the room to get through. In the tiny livingroom, there really are two beds, two screens, two lamps, and nothing else. No place to store anything. It didn\\'t exactly feel homey. \\n\\nThe host gave me one towel for all 5 nights of stay. I think the girls staying in the room asked for more towels, and they didn\\'t get more. When they really asked for a heater and they got a small heater, even my livingroom bed was warmer, and I didn\\'t have to sleep with both my sweater and coat on underneath the thin blanket....The kitchen was missing a paper towel (that I wanted to dry your hands after washing your hands, since the bathroom is sometimes shared between 4 ppl) for liek the first 3 nights of my stay. I think he came into the apt. to set up the bed and to take out the trash, but I don\\'t think he was really cleaning anything. The bathroom has mold, and the whole apt. seemed a bit dusty. \\n\\nI had booked an additional night of stay a week in advance via airbnb, but I don\\'t think the host checked my message in time or looked at the guest list thoroughly. He asked me (he did ask me nicely) when I was going to check out on my 2nd to the last day, which made me panic a little, thinking that maybe I didn\\'t have a place to stay that night. That was when I was in the middle of touring Brooklyn. I was stressed. \\n\\nI hope the host will provide some storage place for guest\\'s clothes, at the very least. I think this place is at a good location (although there are other airbnbs in this location) if you are watching shows, but I think the host can put a little more effort to making the place feel like home. Or at the very least, making the place feel comfortable. I really have never stayed at an Airbnb where I had to hang my clothes over the cheapest room divider screens. There are slightly heavier screens for a little more money. Especially with the screens by both my bed and the other guest\\'s bed constantly falling, I did not enjoy that experience of having to hang or dry my clothes (that I have washed by hand) over the screen. \\n\\nSince there are other airbnb postings at similar prices with elevators or cleaner apt or apt with some way of hanging or storing your clothes/stuff, I would like to recommend finding and airbnb elsewhere until this place gets to be a little more like a home people would actually live in. Excellent  location. I had to pay 220 dlls for a night in a hotel because taz could not receive me at the time we had agreed. great place. highly recommend. close to time square and the metro system to get u anywhere u need. Taz was a great host with a great place! He answered many of my questions before I booked and was always very fast with responding. The location is PERFECT with being only 2 blocks from time square. The place was clean and stocked with basics such as towels, soaps, cups, etc. Highly recommend. We will definitely be back to stay again!! Clean space in a central location; 5 min walk to bus terminal, Broadway, and great restaurants in Hell’s Kitchen. Taz responded very promptly and met me at the apartment at my convenience to give me the keys.  I took off a star only because you have to walk through another bedroom to get to your room which was awkward in the morning and because the heat and A/C weren’t running yet so I was a bit cold. But I was very happy and would definitely come back! He apartment is simple but good. It is next to Times Square and half way to Central Park! Taz was really helpful and kind, that is why I recommend this place! Taz is very attentive to my concerns and responded quickly to my calls. I stayed there for 3 nights but there were 4 different male guests stayed in the open small living area each night. I had to walk across the living area to access bathroom and to exit door. As a single female traveler, I don’t think is safe and provide good privacy. Great host. Prompt in responding. Good hospitality. Excellent location. Overall, loved the place and had a great stay :)\\nHighly recommend to anyone who is looking for a place for temporary stay close to Times Square. This place is perfect, location is great, it was very clean and was kept clean during my staying. There is a private room and then two beds in the living room. \\nThe room is not big but you can have your luggage inside wit oh out any problem (not too much luggage though)\\nThe host was kind and open to answer any question always.\\nI will definitely recommend this place! My friend and I had to book with Taz very last minute, as we had a different airbnb booked and it turned out to NOT be what we thought it was. Taz was absolutely amazing and empathetic to us! A very safe place (my friend and I are 21 year old women) and minutes from Times Square and a great nightlife. Bed was super comfortable; we wish we would’ve booked with him our entire trip! Do not hesitate to stay with Taz! La habitación es como se muestra en la imagen, es ideal para estar un par de días en NY, el departamento tiene lo que necesitas, cocina y baño compartido, muy limpio todo y ordenado. Taz es muy agradable y estuvo al pendiente de nuestra llegada. Recomendable 100 % Taz\\'s place is at a great location close to time square and an amazing value for money. He was super responsive and flexible making the whole stay effortless. Taz\\'s private room was fine.  The place did not have any common area as that was partitioned for other guests with screens.  If you are just gonna sleep there it is perfect Taz was really flexible & helpful with our last minute booking. The City never sleeps but i slept very well :-) Too many ants everywhere \\nToo small space \\nBroken blinds/curtains\\nDirty Bathroom Room was as advertised. Right off Times Square There are a lot of fur of human and we can’t sleep well in this house, and so does bathroom.\\nTowel is so dirty that we couldn’t use.\\nHost sent us a message that gives information about house key.\\nBut in the key box, there is noooo key. We waited a lot of time in the night. And we felt scared. Therefore, we ask of someone for our situation and we can enter the building.\\nBut! There are another guests in there. This house is sharing room.\\nHost didn’t notice about that.\\nEven, It was the opposite sex. \\nSo we slept with man and woman.\\nAnd he lived in India. We couldn’t keep in touch.\\nAfter this bad situation, host answered our messages quickly and apologize.  Had an excellent stay!! Highly recommend. You pay a lower price compared to other options in that area. It is a simple and old place that accommodates reasonably in the bedroom one couple. I stayed there one night and it was ok. Location is the positive thing, but you need to close your eyes to cleaning in bathroom. When circulating in the common areas you should also accept other people sleeping in the two single beds installed in the living room.  Except for initial hiccup of the room not being ready during my check-in time, rest was fine. The location is very good and if you\\'re looking for a short trip and just a place to sleep at night, this place can do. Taz seemed like a decent host. Unfortunately the other guests who’d rented the place were disrespectful and made the experience unpleasant. This was a great location for a great price. I stayed in the back bed room that was uner lock and key. It was small but perfect if you just need a place to sleep, bath and dress. It was not clear how much there was a lack of privacy for those staying in the living room. For my partner and I staying in the back bed room we had to awkwardly walk through the living room where two other guest were staying every time we came into the apartment, every time we went to the bathroom or needed to use the kitchen. It made it very awkward and uncomfortable for all guests. But I suppose the guest in the living room knew what they were signing up for when they reserved the living room. However, it seemed some guest didn\\'t realize they would be sharing the space. Overall the place was clean, we stayed three days and only got one towel so that made the linen situation a little difficult. The bed was comfortable and the air-conditioner was great! The bathroom stayed clean when the cleaning crew came to set up for other guest in the living room. The host worked with me and allowed me to check in my luggage early and usually responded quickly. He said he had an iron but I was not able to ever find it. The location is amazing and I feel like I got what I paid for. This was an amazing experience.  Was hesitant at first but I definitely would do it again. Our roommates were very friendly.   The bed and pillows were top of the line.  Very comfortable.   The best thing was the location.  We couldn\\'t ask for anything better. Taz is the Best! Thank you.  We will be back soon. ☺️ Even if the apartment is very well-located, the bathroom was not clean enough. Besides, even if the bed is pretty good, it is quite uncomfortable in general since there are two other beds in the main room that we have to get through to get into the bedroom.\\nIn conclusion, the bedroom could have been ok for one night if the price was lower. Excellent place The location of the place is perfect!  In heart of Manhattan and just a block away from time square. All you had to do was get out of the building for perfect NYC experience.  Great location of aptm, in a few minutes you stride the sidewalks of Times Square. We mostly walked about the city but subway stations are near. We were lucky to meet a cool roommates but in case there was a j*rk it would be hard to go along. The room is not spacious enough for 4 people in case you want to cook. The price fits the location. From the appliances all works well except the range which is aggravatingly slow. Taz’s reaction were always fast and accurate. \\nFrom me 4/5, minus point for cleanness of towels and bedding. It’s a good place, near Time square and Central park. Thanks one more time. The bed had same sheets previous guest used. There was hairs in the bed and bed was not made when I checked in. I had to buy sheet to sleep and used tshirt over the pillows. The towels in bathroom also seemed dirty and already used. The location is great. Easy check in. Verejne hodnotenie je dobré Nice and smooth..great location + \\nGreat location right next to Times Square \\nClear check-in instructions \\nEasy communication with host \\n\\n-\\nInsects!! Ants all over the place, woke up in the morning with several of them on my arms and legs. The floor and the window were full of ants as well. We had to check all our clothes and things  in the morning and leave ASAP.\\nNo linen. Literally nothing. \\nNo towels. \\nThe place was extremely dirty. \\n Nice and clean place, extremely well located! I cannot rate the appartment itself  because we arrived and were not able to enter because of the missing key in the box in front of the flat. Taz was Not reachable either by phone nor by message. Unfortunately a disappointed Trip to NYC.  Great location!  Muy buen trato I did not have a great experience at Taz’s place. First I did not feel safe in the neighborhood, some homeless people, drugged people, came into the building while I was there. Second, I shared the room/apartment with a stranger, I did not expect that. Third, no towel, no soap, nothing to shower. Fourth, the tube was disgusting, with broken tiles and mold. With the pictures, it is hidden, you can not see it. Fifth, no elevator (3or 4th floor) with big luggages. Not fun. Sixth, you have a powerpoint to find the key. So inexistant check-in. I arrived at 2am and Taz did not replied immediately to me, even if he knew my arrival time. Seventh, the price is really expensive for what you get. So, now you are aware. I would not recommend it how it is.\\nJe ne recommande pas cet endroit, pour le prix vous pouvez avoir mieux dans le quartier. Taz was an amazing host. Easy to communicate with. The place was clean and nice. We had our own cozy bedroom. Great location, check-in and check out very good.  If location is most important to you and you don’t plan to be in the room at all, then this place is okay. It is not very clean though, just an old building that likely couldn’t really feel clean even if you just cleaned it. I just felt I needed to shower after leaving the place and I didn’t really want to shower there. But again if Times Square location is priority, this will do the job.  Amazing place and quick self-check in. Highly recommended  Very bad experience! Never again the worst place very dirty ! Uhhhhh never again!  Taz was amazing at responding to our request and getting us sorted after our previous accommodation fell through - and was consistently quick at responding. The location is amazing too, couldn’t be much closer to Times Square. It isn’t the cleanest place but I didn’t expect it to be and we weren’t too fussed anyway. Total disappointment! \\nwhen I got there, there was no key to check in. So I had to carry my laptops with myself for the entire night. Around 9 PM, the other guests checked out, so I was able to obtain the key to leave my stuff there. Then early in the morning, someone rang the bell, for a few minutes, for multiple times! I imagine eventually the other guest in the living room solved the problem by opening the door for a new guest. \\nThe linen was not washed,  and there was the hair of the previous guests on the pillow.\\nI have stayed in Manhattan, multiple times. This place has been my worst experience up to now. This is okay. Was not exactly as I Expected. Esta ubicado en un lugar con gran acceso a metro y puntos claves de nueva york Pretty good stay for the price point! Only problem was the kitchen was kinda dirty and the bathroom looked really gross, wanted to wear my shoes while talking a show or using the bathroom in general. @ Only a tiny bedroom that is a jungle of dividers and bodies to get too. I would suggest a hotel app and staying at any of the major hotels around broadway for <$120 Taz is nice and responsive and the location is close to Time Square. However, I cannot recommend the place. The apartment was dirty: the bed was made with used linen full of previous guests hair (Taz changed it after we complained), the floor was sticky and dirty, the bathroom has mold on the wall and has missing tiles, there were bugs in the room and some weird odor, the room s tiny - furnished with only a bed, a wall mirror and nothing else.  We were there for 3 nights and felt gross the whole time. Not only that, the apartment is on  4th floor, with dingy stair cases, and no elevator. For $120/night, you can get much better and cleaner places in the area. Location was good. Apartment wasn’t clean. Location is decent, however the whole apartment is very un-clean. Unless you are in a pinch, I wouldn’t recommend staying here. The whole place is very un-inviting. There was hair all over my linens and the bathroom was grotesque. Taz’s communication was excellent. Booked the private room 2 weeks in advance, and was on point during the stay. Easy and fast response. \\n\\nThe lock box for the key is nearby to the apartment. Not the easiest thing to figure out to open, but it’s manageable. \\n\\nI booked the private room, and it was excellent. A queen sized bed. The A/C works. Clean bead sheets and towels. Plug is next to the bed. Door for privacy. \\n\\nThe common area has two twin sized beds on opposite sides with dividers separating them apart. There were two guests during my stay, but with my private room, it was fine. \\n\\nThe kitchen was clean with a big/normal sized refrigerator if you need the space (I didn’t need to use it). \\n\\nThe bathroom was fine. The sink and toilet were clean. The bathtub was clean, but it’s needs some tlc to replace the old tiles that are moldy on the corners. \\n\\nOverall for the $120-$140 price range near Times Square, it’s fine. I only stayed for one night (checked in at 9pm, checked out at 6am). WiFi is fast \\n\\nI got my money’s worth for the stay with the private room. Great location It was a confortable place to stay . Very near from everything. Good location. Ubicación excelente! I will \"not\" recommend this place to anyone, not now, not ever!.  \\n\\nHere are the facts:\\nThe information provided by the owner was very misleading and led me to believe I will be having privacy, but in reality, there is zero privacy.\\n\\nUpon our arrival, we found a total stranger staying in the living room, only separated by a screen surrounding his bed, full of see-through gaps that allow him/her to look at us.  There were clothes, from this total stranger, being hung over the screens and over a lamp at the entrance of the so-called “private room”.  Remember, you are in the middle of Manhattan.\\n\\nIf you needed to use the restroom, you need to walk across the living room, where strangers were being allowed to stay with you.  The accommodation for each stranger was a screen full of see-through gaps where they could easily look at you as you walk through the living room to get to the bathroom, or back.\\n\\nYou need to share only one bathroom, which already look disgusting, with strangers who will also be sleeping next to you. \\n\\nThe bed’s covers looked dirty, used, and with stain when we arrived.  I did not even dared to sit on this bed, as it looked disgusting. \\n\\nI felt unsafe, threaten, and totally unprotected.  Please keep in mind we are talking of the middle of Manhattan, NY.  Imagine yourself sleeping with two complete strangers (each separated only by a screen) where there is no privacy.  In addition to this, these strangers can see through the screen and look at you every time you needed to use the bathroom or simply, just walk through the living room.  Remember you needed to share the bathroom with them.\\n\\nWhen I called the owner the first time, only for a second, he seemed cooperative.  He asked me to wait, that he will call me back.  The second time he call, he was very uncooperative.  \\n\\nI would never ever recommend this place to anyone.  In fact, I just turned around and decided to go to a hotel.  It was not worthy, not even for all the money in the world, to put my life or my heath at risk! Appartement très bien situé, en plein Times square. Idéal pour visiter New York. Amazing host! Very good communication.. The place is very Central and very clean! Highly recommended Best host ! Thank you for your help ! Nice place Walking distance to time square. Quick check in and response. Overall great place to stay! Great space for being in the City! Right by Times Square. Very clean and perfect for a few nights stay! Taz is chill and very friendly! Great stay! great. While Taz came across as a generally friendly person, we were quite surprised by the overall state of the apartment. Having travelled a long distance to spend the night in New York City we entered to find our bedroom sheets filled with hair and markings- a clear indication that the room was not cleaned after the last person used it. In addition to this, Taz showed up at the apartment to give us our keys an hour later than our agreed time. Unfortunately we decided to not spend the night in his apartment because we also could not lock our room door and didn\\'t feel comfortable leaving our possessions out in the open (we shared the apartment with two other guests). Even though we already paid for the apartment, we simply couldn\\'t sleep on used sheets. \\nIn addition to this, I would recommend that Taz provides his guests with a locker space to safely store their belongings. I would also urge Taz to make sure that his guests feel comfortable during their stay in NYC by providing a safe and clean environment for his guests. La habitación es pequeña pero la\\nUbicación es inmejorable, está cerca de todo, llegamos desde el\\nAeropuerto en metro y fue muy sencillo, el baño es muy limpio y cuenta con todas las amenidades. Worked out perfectly. Madison was prompted with answers to questions and patient with my en experience to airbnb. The place is private and located nicely in Manhattan. I was concerned because I forgot to pack towls.there was brand new ones to use in the linen closet.agsin worked out perfectly. His hours of check in and out were absolutely flexible and fit my needs perfectly. Good localization, quiet room, safe area, regular clean.  This was the first time I used AirBnB as I always use hotels.  The experience was different but not in bad way.  One has to be bit more self sufficient as there is nobody waiting for your every request like a hotel.  Madison was very responsive to my questions and had good instructions on usage of the apt.  The neighborhood and apt was safe and the stay was good.   A parte il fraintendimento avvenuto tutto è stato ok camera nella norma bagno nella norma il vero punto di forza è la posizione centralissima che ti permette d arrivare a time square in dieci minuti d cammino il prezzo per la zona è  abbordabile \\r\\nMadison è  una persona molto cordiale \\r\\nConsiglio a tutti coloro che fanno una toccata e fuga e che un po si adattano di alloggiare da Madison\\r\\nLa descrizione dell\\'appartamento è corretta I had a great  stay. The location is perfect. The room has everything you need and the common rooms were  clean. The process  was quick and easy. Madison was very helpful and answered quickly. Madison\\'s apt. was conveniently located near Times Square and we were able to get to all our spots with relative ease.  His place, however, is essentially like a hostel and thus the noise and cleanliness is dependent on the others who are staying with you. Each room has its own lock so you don\\'t need to worry about your stuff. The beds were very high up and if youre cloister phobic may cause you problems. All in all I\\'d recommend this location to anyone who is looking for a confident locale and is ok with a hostely feel. Madison was nice and helpful. The only real complaints is it can be a little dirty and you have to walk up five flights to get to his apt. The listing description was pretty accurate. The room is essentially enough just for one person (for 2 people it is not enough).\\r\\nThe room was dirty ( we cleaned the air-condition filter ourselves since it started making very strange noises  and found 1 cm layer of dirt, there was some hair on the bed and the floor was dirty also).\\r\\nThe couch is not made for sleeping even tough it turns into a bed.\\r\\nThe location is great and so was Madison. He was very responsive and helped us in any way he could. Listing was as listed.  Getting into the place was a little tricky but my daughter and I treated it as a little scavenger hunt.  The room is very small but one would expect that in Manhattan.  Bring all your toiletries because none are provided.  I couldn\\'t get the TV to work but I didn\\'t try that hard either.  Location is listed as Times Square - it\\'s roughly a 15 minute walk to the main areas of Times Square.  All in all it was a decent experience.   I did not meet Madison but he is very responsive.   It was good. For your first time in New York it was perfectly located (10 minutes from Times Square or the Empire State Bulding). Everything you need is in the room. I recommand this place for someone who is used to hostels. I loved this place. The apartment has everything that you need. Good location. Madison was very helpful. He answered every questions very quickly. Easy stay in New York - plane was 4 hours late, but finding key was easy even after midnight. Room was tiny for 2 but sufficient for sleepover - 4 floors up with heavy luggage & no lift (as I expected), Air Conditioning worked fine, which was needed that night, WiFi, public room fine for the little we used it & didn\\'t cook. \\r\\nIn the end, did what we set out to do - walked a few blocks over to Times Square with daughter (only at 3:30am !!!) & met up with the afterparty pizza/diner crowd, and slept til 11am to check out & walk over to Penn Station for JFK.  \\r\\n(note: Schwartz luggage drop for Manhattan is 1 block away from the flat - nothing in Penn Station if you don\\'t have Amtrak tickets, can also arrange airport transport from Schwartz, but we used A line express) The flat is well located near times square and penn station. Madison answers quickly. It\\'s very easy to find the box for the Key even if it was not inside and we had to call Madison (somebody was \"cleaning\" the room...).\\n\\nThe room was quite clean but the bed is definitely too small for 2 persons and the couch is not confortable so it\\'s impossible to sleep on it. \\nThe kitchen seemed ok and clean. (didn\\'t use it). The bathroom was dirty.\\n\\nTo conclude, this room is fine for one person who is used to living with roommates or in hostels. Had a great stay at Madison\\'s apartment. It was clean and in a safe neighborhood. It\\'s close to everything - highly recommended. The location is perfect. The rooms are good and fit for two The location of the apartament is great, Madsion replies very quickly to questions, the neigbourhood was friendly and the streets were crowded even during late hours. Each room can be locked seperately, which was very good. The apartmant was very quite as well. Rooms are pretty small, the bathrooms were not as clean as they could have been during our stay.\\r\\n The apartment is old but clean. There is no host around, all the rooms are being rented out separately and living room/kitchen/bathrooms are shared with other guests. Room is small but well organized with a bunk bed. Wouldn\\'t recommend it for tall people though as the bed is quite short. No street noise but you can hear neighbor\\'s dog barking and people coming in and out. Didn\\'t use the common area but everything seemed OK there. Bathrooms were reasonably clean. Surrounding area is quiet, restaurants and grocery store nearby.\\r\\n\\r\\nI received very detailed and clear instructions about where to find the key to the building. The only problem was that when I arrived the key wasn\\'t there. Fortunately, after waiting for a while by the front door, people were leaving the building so I could sneak in and drop my luggage off upstairs. When going out for dinner the key problem remained.\\r\\n\\r\\nI understand that things like that can happen, in that case the host just needs to be available to resolve the issue. However, to make a long story short, Madison responded very unprofessionally and was plain rude. Didn\\'t believe the key was missing, was angry and making inappropriate comments. He even asked me to pay him extra 50 dollars to come over and arrange the key for me. Obviously I didn\\'t think that was reasonable and finally (a few phone calls and a couple of hours after being first informed about the situation) he sent his cleaning lady over. She was super polite, professional and apologized for the situation. She gave me her own key when she saw the lock box wasn\\'t where it was supposed to be. Apparently city authorities (or someone else) are removing the lock boxes from the fences. Again, things can happen but the host must be willing to manage the situation properly.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo sum up - Apartment is acceptable but host must improve his attitude towards his guests and establish a backup plan for key handover.\\r\\n Good points :\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location of the apartament is very very great, Madsion replies very quickly to questions. The flat is well located near times square and penn station. The room is clean, air Conditioning and wifi worked fine. There are many accessories in the apartment (iron, ironing board, umbrella, hair dryer...). The shop \"Brooklyn Fare\" is just on the left when you go out and the products are good.\\r\\n\\r\\nNegative points :\\r\\n\\r\\nBed too small for 2, and the futon is uncomfortable to sleep. The common areas are dirty (especially the bathroom) when the four rooms are occupied. It is impossible that the cleaning lady comes every day or she must be change.\\r\\n\\r\\nPs : Sheets are provided but please bring your own towels.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note that we had trouble when we arrived. The key retrieved in the lock box was not working. Madison did not answer the phone. We had to make do by ourselves to get into the building (thank you to the neighbor).\\r\\n The whole experience was quite terrible. Firstly, the key was not in the box as directed. Had to trek a few blocks to a Starbucks with my luggage, get on WiFi and contact Madison.  After that delay, couldn\\'t open the building\\'s door because of tricky key/loose lock situation. Others had this problem too.  After finally getting into the building with the help offered by a man (not what a single woman wants to have to accept for safety reasons, but I was getting a little desperate by then), and walking up 5 flights of stairs, got to the apartment door, with the neighbours\\' 2 dogs across the hall yapping incessantly.  They kept that up for hours, each day.  Room itself was unacceptable for the price, with uncovered lightbulb in ceiling for light, plastic bags stuffed around air conditioner as insulation, futon crease encrusted with dirt (hello cleaning lady?) so not touchable, no WiFi password left in room as promised so again required another trek to Starbucks to ask Madison about that, steep and high hike up to a bed with so little clearance for movement since the bed so close to ceiling, a small child would have had difficulty moving around. The neighbourhood itself was good in that it was very close to the Jacob Javitz centre but that alone should not be the reason anyone stays there.  Better to pay more money and not have to endure all the hassles that came with renting this place.  Madison was helpful and responsive, but if all these troubles had not arisen, he would not have needed to be involved in having to help and respond in the first place.  I honestly think he should not rent this place for more than $50/night.  At least then people would get a hint of what they were in for, and get \\'their money\\'s worth\\'.  At the $122/night I paid plus fees for  \\'cleaning\\' (and it was NOT clean) - I feel ripped off and would not want someone going through what I went through.  My daughter has had the opposite experience with Airbnb in terms of great value for the money. Airbnb should vet their \\'landlord\\'s\\' accommodation/advertising/pricing for more consistency in genuine representation of product.\\r\\n Clear process of reservation. Convenient location. Simple accommodations. Thank you, Madison!  This was the perfect location for my friend and I walking distance to most attractions near Times Square. The room is smaller than the other rooms in this apartment but we were aware of that when we booked and it was fine for us it had everything we needed. Area was safe we never had any issues and there is a great deli next door! I would stay here again but would book the bigger room next time! Thanks for the host Madison. Je n\\'ai jamais vu ni parlé à Madison, du moment où je suis arrivée jusqu\\'à mon départ. J\\'ai trouvé l\\'appartement sale et je n\\'avais pas du tout compris que le lit était une mezzanine. Etant fatiguée, ça ne m\\'a pas convenu du tout de dormir perchée et j\\'ai trouvé la chambre très vétuste. Les quatre étages à monter n\\'étaient pas simple avec mes bagages, heureusement, que le gentil voisin était là. Les salle de bain et toilettes étaient peu ragoutants. J\\'ai tout désinfecté avant d\\'y aller, mais n\\'ai pas mis les pieds dans la douche! Comme Madison n\\'est pas sur place, il n\\'y a personne pour faire en sorte que les autres convives, il y a quatre chambres en tout, laissent les lieux propres. La fenêtre de ma chambre avait un climatiseur ais il était orné de part et d\\'autre par des sachets plastiques. La prochaine fois, je prendrai le temps de lire les commentaires des autres visiturs... Aller chercher la clé de l\\'immeuble ailleurs n\\'était aussi pas un plaisir. Je ne reviendrai pas, ni ne recommanderai cette chambre à quiconque. J\\'aurais dû payer l\\'hôtel. Je ne savais pas quoi faire avec la clé de l\\'immeuble, je l\\'ai donc laissée dans ma chambre après l\\'avoir verrouillée. Juste parce que Madison répond rapidement, ne veut pas dire qu\\'il est disponible, en fait, c\\'est son business, de louer ces chambres. Les photos ne sont pas actuelles. Il n\\'a pas voulu m\\'en envoyer d\\'autres par mail quand je le lui ai demandé. Pro: Nice place, close to the times square & easy access to the rest of the city.\\nCon: not enough space for 2people, bed it way too small. Moisty, attracts bugs. \\n La habitación era tal cual aparecía en el anuncio. Tener en cuenta que queda en un piso 5 accesible solo por escaleras. El barrio es bastante tranquilo y cercano a las estaciones de la calle 34 (Linea 7 y E), hay un supermercado a menos de 10 pasos donde es posible encontrar de todo. El lugar posee cocina, pero con platos y servicios de plástico. Lo único malo de este lugar es el calefactor que se enciende a eso de las 5am y libera aire a presión a los pies de la cama lo que genera un gran ruido y me mantuvo despierto los últimos 3 días. El aire acondicionado también es bastante ruidoso. Me encanto el lugar muy limpio y cerca de todo ! Lo recomiendo ! We had a great stay.  Key was easy to find with great directions from Madison.  He was quick to respond to questions.  The room was clean and exactly as described.  I stayed at Madison\\'s Cozy Room #1 for 7 days from 10/22 thru 10/28.  Madison\\'s instructions for making the key pick-up were very detailed and made my check-in process extremely smooth.  My room was quite comfortable and was exactly as Madison described.  Madison\\'s entire apartment is very guest-friendly with access to a full kitchen, 2 bathrooms, and a very welcoming living room with a large sofa and big  flat-screen TV plus all kinds of incidentals.  Madison\\'s housekeeper Florie stopped by every morning to clean up and offer assistance and advice with any questions plus let all guests know her apartment number should any problems arise.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a very pleasant stay at Madison\\'s apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\nTony Janicki I would recommend not staying in Cozy Room # 1.  The bed for two is a twin size bed meant for one person.  It is too small for two people.  I had my face against the wall all night, and my husband had his against the railing of the loft bed.  The hot pipe that runs up the wall at the end of the bed burns your feet if you accidentally touch it in the middle of the night.  It also lets off noisy hot steam that wakes you up and makes the room unbearably hot.  The mattress is a piece of foam on top of plywood.  \\r\\nThe host does not live there but rents out four rooms, each with a combination lock on the door.   We received the wrong combination to begin with, and had to stall for a few hours before we could get in our room.  Then it malfunctioned one morning and locked us out.  The cameras all around the shared living room may be necessary, but do not make it feel warm an cozy.\\r\\nThey key pickup is half a block away around a corner.  The lock box is on a fence on the sidewalk.  It was only slightly difficult to find, but since it was dark and we had been flying all day, it was annoying.\\r\\nIt is a good location and fairly quiet.  We have stayed in 20 - 30 airbnb rooms all over the world, including others in New York City, and this is the only bad review I have ever felt the need to post. We had a little issue with password door in apartment at check-in, but Madison fixed very fast. \\r\\nWe didn\\'t meet Madison, but he answered all questions about the apartment very quickly.\\r\\nI would recommend not staying in Cozy Room # 1, but the other rooms I believe are more big.\\r\\nGood things:\\r\\n*The localization is nice, very close of Times Square.\\r\\n*The apartment was clean and common area is good.\\r\\n*Supermarket very close of apartment.\\r\\n*Easy to find the lock box on a fence on the sidewalk.\\r\\n*Bathroom was clean, depends too of the other people who stay there to keep this way.\\r\\n\\r\\nBad things:\\r\\n*so small bed for couples;\\r\\n*small room;\\r\\n*5 floor is bad for many luggages, because don\\'t have elevator, hard job to go upstairs.\\r\\n*The hot pipe that runs up the wall at the end of the bed burns your feet if you accidentally touch it in the middle of the night. It also lets off noisy hot steam that wakes you up and makes the room unbearably hot.\\r\\n*The Madison\\'s housekeeper didn\\'t clean our room after check-in, we stayed there 7 days.\\r\\n\\r\\nI might stay there again, but i will choose another room e not many luggages!\\r\\nWe liked to stay there! God beliggenhed. Mangelfuld rengøring og lettere ukomfortable sovepladser.  good I wouldn\\'t recommend renting this room if you have more than 1 person, as each Bed very small and only the top bed is comfortable to sleep on, the futon is as hard as a rock.  There is also this hot pipe that will cause you paid if you stretch your feet in the night and hit it which is likely, the pipe also blows out steam which makes the room very hot. Not even hand soap in bathroom, I left a bar for the next guest but be expected byo. Also it\\'s up 5 levels so pack light as there is no elevator.  \\n\\nPros: Location is great! This is the best thing about this. As you are 10-15 min walk from time square and macys etc. so if you book here, book the bigger room! \\n\\n Una amiga me lo recomendó ya que ella había hecho uso de esta pagina y no tuvo ningún problema.  the information Madison offered was very detailed and correct, very easy to find. Overall our experience of NY was awesome, but we felt the issues we had with the room did tarnish it a little. As for location, this place cannot be beat. 10 mins to Times Square, and a great base for exploring the city. It\\'s secure and although the street/neighborhood looks a bit suss, it\\'s not, that\\'s just NY. My main issues were that there were 2 of us and the sleeping arrangements aren\\'t suitable for 2. Sure there is a loft bed (which even though it is stated as a twin, is only meant for one) and the \\'bonus futon\\' that is actually meant to sleep the second person (so not a bonus really, just the second bed) is just way too hard and uncomfortable to suffice. It\\'s not a full size futon as described (it folds to the same width as the single loft bed) and doesn\\'t completely fold down in the space provided for it. Madison told me to move it length ways in the room but it doesn\\'t fit as the fixed ladder for the loft bed and the other furniture takes up too much space to do so. We made do and I removed the foam topper off the loft bed to put onto the futon so it was bearable for my partner to sleep on. Problem was that there were some nasty stains on it that looked like blood. Not good. Also we only had one blanket and two seperate beds. Also not good was that the one blanket did have blood stains on it! (& unwashed). As we had arrived from our flight late, I was forced to use it. The hot pipe that others have mentioned burning them has still not been dealt with. I found out that the building has steam heating, so in each room there are pipes running from floor to ceiling that have a valve at the top which periodically let\\'s out steam. The valve in room 1 is broken as it let\\'s out way too much steam (compared to the pipes in the rest of the apartment which are nearly silent) is very loud and therefore the pipe it\\'s attached to becomes extremely hot(the other pipes get warm to the touch). It is stationed at the end of the loft bed (and therefore the futon also) and you WILL be burnt throughout the night if you touch it. When I spoke to Madison about this he seemed surprised and was unsure of how I was getting burnt even though it\\'s quite obvious that others have brought this to his attention. He assured me that the bedding and pipe issues were going to be addressed the next day but they weren\\'t. I finally received clean bedding a day after that, but the burnt feet issue still wasn\\'t fixed by the time we left. The last issue I had was the cleanliness of the property. The housekeeper had visited the morning of check in but the place was pretty dirty.... Madison was awesome, great response time. The place was easy to get too with an awesome location. We loved it! Very attentive to my self-caused problems. Everything worked out quickly and simply. Room was everything I asked for and booked in a hurry. Ancienne maison assez différente de ce que l on peux voir d habitude \\nCommerciale car chaques chambre à son verrous donc pas de convivialité et on ne rencontre jamais le propriétaire ..\\nVersion hôtel \\nClef qui ouvre la porte une fois sur 10 \\nChauffage qui fait pssssss toute la nuit et donne envie de pisser :) Great location This place was just as described.  Nice low cost option for staying in Manhattan.  The apartment was clean, quiet, and had everything we needed.  The location is hard to beat.  Walking distance to the convention center and times square.  Lots of local parking for extended stay, and easy to access from the Lincoln Tunnel.  The room gets a little warm on the top bunk, and the steam pipe is a little noisy, but this is all pretty normal for NYC apartments.  Definitely recommend!  First, the pluses: If you\\'re going to the Javits Center as I was, there is nothing more convenient, barely 2 blocks away. And Madison was a very accommodating host, allowing me to leave my bags in the apartment both before and after checkout time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe minuses? Shower had soot (or black specks of something) covering the tub floor (was going to take a picture but no time for that); was gross and took 10 minutes to clean. And as others have noted, the private rooms are really tiny. I\\'m not a large person at all but felt very cramped; I certainly wouldn\\'t recommend for 2. Also, I know 5th floor walkups are a New York standard, but it\\'s trying.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother positive, though: I was bushed after a long day including an emergency landing of my flight and then convention parties. Happily, unit was very quiet and I slept like a log. Great hosting, place and location! Everything came out as it was acorded  Madison is a good host and made our arrival and key pickup/drop off very easy. \\r\\nThe room itself is rather small, but location-wise it\\'s perfect for exploring the city. Despite the feedback shared by other guests, bed was perfectly sufficient for 2 people. \\r\\nRegarding drawbacks, be aware that the heating pipe that other travelers have mentioned does cause problems - at some point of time it starts to release steam and is quite noisy when it does that (we had trouble falling asleep on the first day, but then got used to it). Due to that, be prepared that it may get quite hot inside, even if you open the window.\\r\\nFinally, on our last day we killed a cockroach in the room, which was not a pleasant feeling.  My aunt and uncle spent a great time in this apartment.  I went down to New York for the weekend with a friend and we both really enjoyed staying at Madison\\'s place. \\n\\nIt was in a great central location. Everything we wanted to do was either walking distance or easily accessible through close public transit. \\n\\nIt was a little tight with two people, but more importantly, it was clean and the bed was comfortable. \\n\\nMadison was very friendly and easy to get a hold of.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend his place to others. This is the perfect place to stay if money is a big concern, which was a big motivating factor for me. This place is a very low cost and those that choose this option should know that it is spare. It\\'s perfect, if you want to be near everything and only spending time at the home to sleep.   First of all, I would like to commend Madison for his swift, friendly responses to my questions. And the apartment is very well located. Second, if I am to be honest (and this is just to help Madison improve things), I would not descibe the room as \"cozy\", at all. It was functional and rather spartan (the wood ladder could be improved a bit). There were no extra sheets for the sofa bed (which I had enquired about using as I was traveling with my teenage son). I found a flat sheet and a comforter in the closet but those were obviously intended for the loft bed which, when we arrived, had only the fitted sheet on it. I therefore had to put the flat sheet and the comforter on the sofa bed so my son could sleep there, and I ended up sleeping with neither a top sheet nor a comforter. There was no soap (not even hand soap) or bath products in the bathroom. We only slept there a few hours as we only had one night in NYC but I feel the end price of 110 euros (59 for the room, and 36 for housecleaning and 15 for \"service\") a bit steep. 59 euros would have been more appropriate. Sorry for the negative elements but it\\'s to be helpful for the future. Also, please do warn guests about parking in the street across from the apartment (it\\'s only ok from 7pm to 7am).  La atención es muy buena, Madison siempre contesto rápido a los mensajes que le enviamos, aunque no lo hallamos (Website hidden by Airbnb) ubicación también es muy buena llegas caminando a todos lados.\\nLo malo es la suciedad del lugar, nunca limpiaron en los 3 días que estuvimos, ni  en los baños ni en la habitación, la alfombra del baño era un asco  We arrived at the apartment at about 1PM New York time and the key box where we were supposed to find our key was completely empty, the instructions given to us were very clear and specific and we had no actual trouble finding anything however when we emailed and called Madison about it he was working and it took three hours to hear back from him which was a bit of a bad situation as we had all of our suitcases with us and usually he was always very quick to respond. Luckily a nice lady let us into the building so we were able to go upstairs as the keys are only needed for the front doors and the room for the apartment nad the rooms in the apartmens work with a code which we had from the instructions. However we were not able to leave as we had no key so we had to wait for that. Eventually the cleaning lady came and gave us the key. The apartment itself was not very clean in my opinion but I guess everyone has their own standards on what is clean. The location for this apartment is great and all in all for the price of the apartment I would recommend it to others.  The location was good, but the bath and room was not really clean. Perfect location!! Room was ready and perfect for our arrival. The directions Madison gave us to the lock box were very detailed and easy to follow. He was very responsive when I had questions. We will stay here again next time we come to New York!!  Madison was very organized and on top of things for our stay. House rules were clearly laid out and all guests were very considerate of each other\\'s space. The location was great - right in restaurant territory. The room was a bit cramped for two people, but is what you would expect for NY. We had a nice stay. Nice cozy place, easy directions, and the owner was always available if something came up and would even check up on you to see how things are going. 5 stars! More if it was possible.  Positivo: la ubicación es muy buena, estas a 10 minutos  de times Square caminando.  Tiene lo necesario \\r\\n\\r\\nNegativo: la habitacion es pequeña, si no te gusta estar en la sala compartida no vas a tener mucho espacio  Madison was very detailed in instructions on how to get the key which made checking in easy! He was responsive from the beginning and answered any questions we had. This was our first Airbnb experience and I was very happy with it. The room looks just like the pictures and it was a clean and inviting space.  The room was private and had two ways to lock the door. The bed was ready and clean and actually pretty comfortable. The room also had its own mini fridge and AC. There was another guest in another room, but they were friendly! There were two shared bathrooms, both clean and ready. Madison\\'s place is in a great location! We were able to walk to his place from Times Square, it was awesome! I would recommend staying here!  Madison was a great host. We didn\\'t manage to catch up with him since we only stayed 1 night and left pretty early, however he was very responsive with any questions we had. Room was great! We stayed at Madisons appartement for the 4th of july weekend. The location is great and easilly accesible which was perfect. The apartment itself is basic. We thought it could have been cleaner, especially the bathroom, which also had no toiletpaper when we arrived. We did not get to meet Madison himself. It was quite a downer when we could not reach him when the keys were not at the location where he said they would be and had to wait outside the building for 30 min untill a neighbour helped us out. At other moments he was responsive. We would recommend this place if you are just looking for place to sleep at a good location. Right in the centre, very easy access, very clean and organised. The room was as described. We had minor confusion when we arrived as we couldn\\'t figure out the key situation, but another person in the apartment was very helpful and we got in. The room was clean and cozy and was perfect for our needs. Looking at the pictures, I didn\\'t realize that the bunk bed is a double, so my daughter slept with me in the bunk. The sofa is very uncomfortable. Madison responds pretty quickly and is willing to help. We would recommend his place. Thanks Madison!! This was my first time using Airbnb and it was adventourous. Anytime I had a question for Madison, he was quick with a response. His place reminded me of a shard college dorm. Room a little tight but not a problem when with your loved one. Thank you Madison!! La estancia ha sido muy agradable, y las  personas encontradas también, muy céntrico, solo una sugerencia en lo alto de la escalera debería tener algo acolchado porque al poner la rodilla en el filo de la cama hace daño...lo demás todo correcto, gracias. Madison\\'s gig is a well oiled machine.  The check in process is quick.  He answers messages almost instantly.  The space is quite comfortable.  Definitely a good alternative to staying in a hotel. Good location. Clean. I will definitely stay there again. 타임스퀘어를 걸어갈수있는위치(어차피 지하철이 매우 잘되어있음 오히려 조금 걷는게 귀찮)\\r\\n개인적인 공간\\r\\n\\r\\n을 강력하게 선호하는 사람만 방문하세요\\r\\n\\r\\n이 가격이라면 그냥 호스텔 가겠습니다. 좁아터진방, 엘리베이터도 없는 5층, 침대가 이층침대처럼 사다리타고 올라가야되서 에어컨틀면 냉기가 안올라옴 \\r\\n\\r\\n그냥 딱들어갔을때 물리고싶었습니다. 어쩔수없이머무르긴했지만 Nice location and good communication! This is my second time visit his room because I had good experience in this location last time. Great place to stay. Very accessible, close to both times square and subway stations. Clean, secure and functional. Madison is always just a message away and is very quick to respond. The only feedback I have is about the air conditioning which sometimes fails to circulate to the bed which is in the upper half of the room. \\nWould definitely love to come back! I enjoyed my stay at Madison\\'s. The room was really cosy and he allowed me to leave my baggage behind for a bit to have my lunch after my check-out. Truly a kind soul! This room was a good deal in a very convenient neighborhood. Be aware that the furnishing and amenities are sparse. The location of this room could not have been better, and it was an amazing value for the price! \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a slight issue finding the key at check-in (lock-box was empty) but Madison responded to my text almost instantly with a solution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis room DOES NOT have a futon as suggested in the listing. It has a broken little 5-foot-long fold out couch with metal bars running through it...the floor would be more comfortable. We had two people and we ended up sharing the loft bed which was totally comfortable, but you should know that if you have two people you will be sharing the bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was clean enough, and the rest of the amenities were exactly as described! Overall an amazing value for an amazing neighborhood. We were steps from the Javits Center and didn\\'t have to use any transit at all during our stay because we were close enough to walk everywhere. I would stay here again just for the value and the location. The place was neat and tidy but had dust on shelves in the closet. The room is really small but if you\\'re looking for a relatively cheap place for a short stay near penn station this will do for a couple nights. Madison provided really good instructions to allow us to get into the property and was very good at getting back to us quickly to sort out any problems. The property is in a great location for getting around and seeing everything in New York. The room is exactly as shown in the photos and was fine for us as we weren\\'t there very much at all. The only slight problem was that the air con doesn\\'t reach the bed as it is underneath it and therefore it can get pretty hot at night! Overall though we had a good stay!  Very good  We were e-mailed final details day of and got the apartment smoothly. It was very close to the convention center which was perfect and there were plenty of restaurants near by.  Hi Madison,\\r\\nafter our problems at the start lockbox and the mysterious doors, we were very happy with our flat. Thank you for the wonderful days in our room. It was great!\\r\\nBecause of you, we were in the heart of NY! It was very easy to get everywhere with walking our the Subway.\\r\\nA lovely advice from two housewives:)\\r\\nIf the beds are full , ist wouldnt be bad to clean the Fluor in the bathroom.\\r\\nAgain, thank  you for everything!\\r\\nIt was very great!,\\r\\nRuth and Carola\\r\\n The room was perfect \\nYou can use the kitchen Madison helped us out by allowing us to drop off our luggage prior to check in. Note that it you are able to do this, you will have to leave your things in the common room. But we had no troubles with this. Try to pack lightly because those four flights of stairs are narrow. The apartment is quieter than we expected. Hot water seemed to keep up. With demand. Bathrooms were very clean. Would be nice if they supplied wash cloths along with the towels. Location is pretty good. 15 minute walk to 34th Street-Penn Station and close enough to Times Square and the theatres.  Good location and great value! Bon logement pour la découverte de la ville personne disponible par le site!  The apartment was very close to the Convention Center, so close I was able to stop in between sessions during the day.  There were many local delis and a pharmacy around the corner. Broadway district was in walking distance as well.  I enjoyed my stay immensely.  La zona es muy tranquila y cercana de estaciones del Tren subterraneo, El departamento siempre estuvo limpio y con todos los servicios, pequeño refrigerador, plamcha dentro del cuarto, y la cocina estaba equipada para poder cocinar y comer en el departamento. En general muy buena experiencia. Perfect location - steps to time square! The room was comfortable and we received quick responses before the trip! Definitely will be back  The apartment was super convenient to Times Square and walking distance to everything we planned to do. Although we didn\\'t get to meet Madison he  gave great checkin instructions to ensure we had a smooth process. The space was exactly as described and the price worked well for our stay. Would definitely make this one of my NY faves. Madison\\'s place is excellent. With so many sights, sounds, and attractions all within walking distance but just far enough away from the noise, the location is unbeatable. The space itself is clean and while other Airbnb\\'ers share a common area, the bedroom room has its own personal lock and code for you to maintain your privacy. Madison as a host was great. He was able to help my fiancé and I out on extremely short notice. While we didn\\'t get the chance to meet, Madison was fantastic in replying to questions ranging from house rules, directions to the space, and recommending places to eat. I couldn\\'t have gotten any luckier with a great host and a great space. Definitely coming back to NY in the future and Madison\\'s will be the first place I look! Es war super, super Lage nur zu empfehlen  The location of the apartment is amazing. It\\'s just a few minute walk to Times Square and other great attractions. The room is small, but that\\'s expected. The bed was very comfortable.  Great location for our stay in Manhattan. We had difficulty accessing the apartment due to the key not being in the spot where the instructions had said. However, a neighbour kindly let us in and once we had access to wifi to communicate with Mason, he was very speedy with his responses. The apartment was true to how the pictures and description states, however the cleanliness was slightly below standards I would have personally expected. Overall, we had a really good stay at Mason\\'s place and thought it was good value for money. Madison\\'s place is in a great location, within walking distance to everything we wanted to see in NYC. The room was clean and spacious. Madison was also very responsive to questions emailed to him. The instructions on how to get the key from the lockbox were clear and I had no trouble. I was surprised that it was pretty quiet at night. The only noise you could hear from outside was the occasional siren. Thanks very much. We had a pleasant stay. Good location, nice small room, you have to climb 5 floor (in case you have walking issue ) and good for young traveler. Madison is great and careful. Always ready to ping you back   I enjoyed staying here and will do again if I have business in Manhattan. It\\'s close to everything that\\'s important. Great host, usually replies within 10 minutes. Rooms are exactly the same as the pictures.  Madison\\'s place was perfect for a small quick trip to NYC. Easy to get to and close to many areas! Would definitely try it again! Madison was a great host, I felt very at home and safe in this listing. 10/10 would stay again! Great deal.  Room got a little warm for me, but it was fine Fantastic stay. This is a perfect location and fantastic deal for the area. I\\'ve stayed here twice, and will again. A nice place, very private, with lock on the bedroom doors and clear instructions to check-in.  Madison\\'s place was great and close to everything! Would definitely stay here again Madison was a great host.  The place was clean and minimalist.  Appreciated the ease of check in! Great Spot!  Easy to follow instructions regarding checking in sent the day before.  Really quick replies to any questions asked.  Only complaint - there is a heating pipe located close to the bed that would go on and off with hissing sounds throughout the night, but guessing it can\\'t be helped.  Overall we were really happy with our stay. Place was clean, saw a couple other guests staying in other rooms, but was never an issue, everyone followed the rules set out, were quiet late at night.  Would stay again.   We didn\\'t see our host, but the place was efficient and convenient. This is a convenient stay for anyone who just needs a place to crash while exploring the city. I\\'d recommend Madison\\'s place to other Airbnb guests anytime.  I would definitely recommend this stay. Madison was very responsive and the room was perfect location.  - Lo mejor sin duda fue la ubicación, hicimos casi todo caminando.\\n- Limpieza, nunca vimos a nadie pero un día nos dejaron una toalla y el departamento siempre estuvo limpio.(Se respetaron las reglas de convivencia entre los huespedes).\\n- La habitación era pequeña, tenía un entre piso que era solo cama para 2 personas, tv, una heladerita, placard, y un sofa. Tenía una escalera para subir, lo cual puede incomodar(nosotros no tuvimos problemas).\\n\\nSegún mi experiencia, volvería a alquilar. \\n Great place to stay! Easy check in and plenty of room.  위치도 터미널이랑 가깝고 타임즈 스퀘어나 엠파이어빌딩 등 쪽으로도 가기에도 편하고 다운타운으로 가기에도 좋앗어요~ I recommend this place. Very clean, good instructions, immediate responses. Very functional and in my case in the perfect location close to Javits Center. The high bed was surprisingly comfortable.  very near to Jacob convention center Place is as described! La ubicación del apartamento es muy Central, con fácil acceso al Time Square, restaurantes y estaciones de metro \\nLa habitación tal cual como se muestra en la Foto ( pequeña ) y el anfitrión atento a cualquier recomendación  Had a great time in New York, great communication with Madison and loved our room. Our stay at Madison\\'s house was great. It\\'s crazy central located, just 5 walking minutes to Times Square and also lots of other central points (bus tours, metro stations) are nearby. The flat was really clean, especially the bathrooms. Unfortunately, we had a a room with a quite noisy heater that sizzled sometimes a bit. However, we would ever come back for our next stays! Very central and close to everything at the Times Square region  Perfect for a couple of nights in the heart of New York City, with a comfortable bed and a quiet room. El alojamiento es tal cual se muestra en las fotos. La ubicación es espectacular. La comunicación con el anfitrión muy buena. Lo único que no nos gustó es que en la conocía había cucarachas, lo que no nos permitía cocinar.. la basura se acumulaba. \\nAgradezco de todos modos la estadía Exactly as described!  Just what we expected! This place is all you need for coming home after a long day in the city. Great location, and very comfy bed. Would stay again for sure, great value for exactly what is advertised! 10-15 minute walk to Penn Station. Bedroom is small, but clean. Did not have to use taxi or subway for my visit, as a lot of places are walking distance. Be aware that this room is located on the 5th floor, with no elevator. That can serve as a built-in stair-stepper instead of going to a gym. The area is very quiet. Full kitchen is available, but I did not use it. Room has a \\'steam valve\\', which can be noisy, but it only was on for short periods. Be aware that the bed is a \\'loft bed\\', so it will be like going to summer camp, with being on the top bunk. It would be very snug for 2 people, as it is about the size of a twin mattress. The mattress was very comfortable. Be sure to avoid going to bed drunk or stoned, because if you have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, the ladder could be tricky. Hope your insurance would cover that sort of thing. Could not located a hair dryer, but I am sure Madison will find it for next visit. Madison was very quick to respond to my initial question. Good value for people on a budget, as I do not like spending $300 or more for a hotel.  Check-in was easy, place was clean, and we felt safe. The room was smaller than we expected, but the description does say cozy, but all we did was sleep there, and it was convenient to everything. It is a shared bathroom - one full bath, and one half bath. Sharing with others didn\\'t cause any issues. Thanks! I wanted a place to sleep that was close to all of the Broadway theatres, and Madison\\'s place was perfect for that. He was very accurate in his descriptions, so we knew we would have five flights to climb. The room was clean and we were mostly there to just sleep and shower. It is within walking distance to Times Square and close to grocery stores and restaurants. Madison was very communicative, responsive, and friendly. I would plan to book this place for future trips! The location of the place is good, it is safe and the bed very comfortable, however it was very dirty everywhere.  If it improves the cleanliness the place looks perfect. Very clean place. Awesome location.\\nMadison is a great host!! Great location and easy to pick up. The bed was very comfortable and easy to get into. The bed is bunk bed style with the bed up top and a mini couch underneath. Keep in mind the way up is a ladder affixed to the frame for stability. Very quiet room with air conditioner, tv, mini fridge and desk area.  Great location and value for money. We were able to sit in the shared area for an hour after check out before our travel plans Very conveniently located and the host is very responsive. Madison\\'s place was easy to find and within walking distance to bars, restaurants, cafes and shops. The room was perfect for two to share for a night. \\n\\nNo hand soap/hand towel provided so make sure to pack your own! Its very good located but thats the only good thing to say :( \\nIt was not clean, you can\\'t look out of the windows because they are sooo dirty, lots of hair in the bathroom and also in the bath towels  Great location and value for exploring midtown. Room is cozy but we had everything we needed.  Great location.  Great value. Alles wie beschrieben. Madison\\'s apartment was perfect for my first trip to New York. Being able to stay right in the heart of Manhattan near all the hot spots for such an affordable price is great. Madison was extremely helpful with letting me know how to get into the place, and answered all my questions quickly. I\\'ll definitely stay here again next time in in the city! It was a nice and clean place. It\\'s location makes it very convenient to commute. I recommend this place. Madison was excellent in answering questions prior to arrival and instructions for getting into the building, apartment, and room were clear. I stayed three nights. It\\'s a fifth floor walk-up. My room was simple with a loft bed, which was kind of fun climbing up into each night - reminded me of being a kid again. There was also a small couch beneath the loft bed that laid down flat to make another bed, if needed. While it was basic and simple, Madison included amenities like a TV and cable box in this room (I assume also in the others), an iron, a small fridge, and the great wi-fi. The commons area was tidy with a kitchen available and cable TV. My room had no view, perhaps the other 3 or 4 rooms did, I don\\'t know, but a view wasn\\'t needed. This is a great basic place to lay your head at night and good value for the money. This is a great place to stay. The room is small but it\\'s totally workable. I would stay here again.  Buena ubicación, lamentable que no haya ascensor (5to piso).  Las comodidades son según se describen. Lugar para estar como máximo 3 días.  Madison\\'s space was a great place to stay! Honestly it was so close to all the places my boyfriend and I wanted to go visit. Everything was walking distance or a quick Lyft / subway trip away. The space was sooo clean. The mini fridge inside the room was helpful too! There is an air conditioner in the room however since there is a loft bed, it can get hot at night since heat generally rises. Also, the bathroom sinks get hot during the day however I believe that\\'s just due to the hot summer weather. Other than that I really enjoyed my stay and Madison was GREAT with communication. Thanks again! Really good location, with everything you needed for a great stay!  Lage super, Kommunikation mot Madison Problemlos :) kleines süsses zimmer :)  Small room but perfect for sightseeing etc. Very close to Times Square and Empire State Building . Easy to access . As mentioned in the add it is on the fifth floor but it\\'s worth it for being so central . Really enjoyed our stay here . One small thing is that the key was a bit difficult to use in the front door but this is probably a problem with the building and not the host (the host did warn us about this beforehand) . Overall a great experience.  La ubicación es lo mejor de esta habitación, a unos 15 minutos de Times Square. Lo demás deja bastante que desear, especialmente la limpieza de todo el piso, habia cucarachas en la cocina y la habitación, hay una cocina como muestran las fotos pero no hay utensilios para cocinar, ni un simple vaso. En verano por la noche es insoportable el calor, aún con el aire acondicionado encendido, ya que al estar la cama en un altillo, el aire frio no sube hacia arriba.  El alojamiento muy bueno,lo re recomiendo. La ubicacion estaba buenaa..cerca de todo. Y el departamento nos gusto.. cada uno tiene su espacio y esta bueno como esta distribuido. Medio cansador el tema de que no haya asensor. Pero totalmente que volveria y lo recomendaria !! The proximity of this room to Times Square, shows, restaurants and public transit is ideal for someone who wants to do it all while in NYC. \\n\\nThe only downside to our stay was the temperature. I\\'m a southern girl, so humidity and high temperatures are nothing new to me. The apartment was very warm, and it was difficult to feel cool and comfortable, especially after walking so much throughout the day and dancing, which was the purpose of my trip. \\n\\nMadison was a great communicator and I appreciated his promptness in answering questions for us throughout the week.  Loved that there were two restrooms Great stay!  Great location and great value. Everything was very clean going in. Just be weary of other guests and show courtesy to them as they could potentially be asleep. But if you\\'re looking to find a good way to immerse into New York culture at a great price, it\\'s a great booking. Less than a ten minute walk to Penn station which takes you everywhere in the city, a market in the next building over, and a location right near the Lincoln tunnel crossing, which keeps the street relatively quiet at night.  Bom preço para a localização. Um pouco sujo e a cozinha não tem utensílios praticamente nenhuns. Comunicação com o proprietário foi sempre muito eficiente  The location is relly great for exploring the city, just  few blocks down from Times Square and right next to Hells Kitchen. The room was ok and spacious enough for two people and a couple of days stay. But we were not sure that sheets and towels were clean or changed after the last guests, finding old band aids from former guests  in the sheets is not a great way to wake up. Also the kitchen was only equipped with plastic and styrofoam plates and a few plastic knives, no spoons, forks, whatsoever. If you just want a place to sleep, this is great. But cooking and travelling on a budget is a little difficult. We very much enjoyed our trip to New York and Madison\\'s place was perfect for the occasion. The room was clean and we had no problem with other guests. The apartment is situated in a prime location and despite the accommodation being simple it provided everything we needed for our stay.\\nMadison was flexible with check in time and was quick to respond to communications. This place is a very very nice place, very clean, near to time square and all the bets places of new york.. Madison\\'s place is surprisingly quiet given its proximity to Times Square, which is, of course, another one of the positives.  The apartment was clean and tidy and a comfortable place to rest.  I would have no hesitation to book it again. Very good apartment, good location. Considering the price, the dirt in the bathroom was ok. I really do recommend this apartment! Thanks! Lo mejor del apartamento la ubicación!! Increíble! \\nEl apartamento tal y como aparece en las fotos: pequeño pero más que suficiente para dormir y descansar! \\nHubiera agradecido algo más de limpieza, pero estaba correcto! \\nLa comunicación con Madison fue perfecta y la entrada y salida fue sencilla cuando nosotros quisimos! \\nRecomendable para gente joven, viajera, aventura,...\\nOjo es un cuarto sin ascensor (se hacia muy fácil subir) y la cama está en un altilllo y hay que subir con una escalera!\\nRecomendable! Muchas gracias Great location. The price is perfect for what it is. Enjoyed the stay very much, I\\'d stay there again. Great communication with the host, excellent location. Slept like a baby :) Best deal in town.  The check in sounds complicated but is actually very easy.  Easy to find and amazing location.  Cannot beat it.  Room/apartment was also great! Madison is a wonderful host. His place is cozy, quant and situated in a great location. Walking distance to everyting. I have absolutely no complains. Excellent location with easy access to supermarkets and restaurants \\nAffordable price in the big apple The place looks like the pictures. The neighbors in the building are really nice. The apt location was great, we walked everywhere. The other people staying in the apt were barely heard or seen and everything was clean. Great place to stay! I would stay here again. This is my second time staying at Madison’s place and it will continue being my top choice when visiting NYC. Great location, value, and Madison is very communicative and a great host. Great values. The apartment is close to everything.  Easy check in and out. It was close to Time\\'s square. He was nice person and replied very quickly. Thanks to his, my stay in NY was awesome. Black marks on both towels in the room, no hand soap in the bathroom, and even though they said they will bring them after I told them, they never did, I doubt it that they ever change the sheets between guests. Very tiny small room not worth it at all for the price they charge. This listing is great if are looking for minimal amenities and just a room to stay at night. The room was not that large but two-three people could easily fit. The shower was not clean because some earlier tenants did not feel the need to clean it. It’s right in Hell’s Kitchen and close to many bars and restaurants. Overall it was a positive experience but in the future I would choose somewhere else Overall, the stay was great. We felt we have our own space altho it\\'s shared as the flat was secured perfectly.\\n\\nThe common areas like kitchen, living room and toilets are all clean. The location is ideal!! Easy to get to public transportation. Market is just a few steps away. \\nLoft with full size bed on top. Clean sheet, cotton blanket and two pillows were provided. Great pillows btw. Futon is worn that\\'s below the loft but I\\'m sure that\\'s just bc of the amount of people who pass through. Room was clean. Had a small trash can for us. That was nice so we didn\\'t have to go to the kitchen to throw small things away. The Window ac worked well. We stayed in November and most nights the temps were cool so no need for AC :)Room had a mini fridge which was great!! \\nLoved the power strip in the room!! There\\'s a closet to put luggage in. A few hangers are provided. Large wall mirror in room was nice to get ready for the day or evening. Quiet neighborhood. We would definitely stay again. Host was very quick to respond to messages sent Super easy to get in and out. I can\\'t say enough good things about his place!!! Very good place to stay, very close proximity to the Javits center and other great midtown locations. Had a great stay if your looking for something simple and just a place to sleep and shower. The place is a good spot for getting around Manhattan. Host communication is great. The place is not as clean as we like a home, but it served its purpose. \\n Simple-secure-clean...good location close to bus terminal, subway and Times Square. It\\'s a small room, but definitely worth the value if you\\'re just looking for a place to crash for the night. It was everything we needed for our stay, and comfortable, too: the AC was a definite plus, and there was plenty of room for two on the bed. We didn\\'t end up having to interact with anyone during our stay, which was nice, too - it made check-in and check-out super easy and simple. Thumbs up for sure. The perfect place for a getaway to NYC. Provides exactly what it says. Excellent value. Will be my preferred place to stay if travellng here again! Madison was an excellent host and most things were as expected. The location is quite good with Times Square about a 15 minute walk away. The apartment is on the 5th floor, so it’s 4 flights of stairs up. The only unexpected thing was the heating system was quite loud when we slept (because the building is old), but you get used to it. I was quite worried about the apartment being warm enough during one of the colder weeks in NYC this year. My fears were misplaced as the entire place was warm and toasty due to the piped steamed heating in all the rooms. The 5 flights of stairs were pretty effortless as the flights are quite short. Madison was super-communicative in arrangements that were clear and to the point. The sleeper couch in the room is quite uncomfortable and needs replacement, but overall the place was clean, had all the basics and was quite secure. A great location as well! The location, the check in and the communication was great and super easy! \\n\\nPerfect stay for one night Our room was on 5th floor, the stairs are relatively steep and narrow. Room is small, but there\\'s enough space for 2 big peaces of luggage. There\\'s also a refridgerador. The heating system was a bit strange for us, and really loud at times, such that it may interrupt your sleep. Bathrooms could be cleaner. Location is great, close to subway and times square. Host is very friendly. All in all not a bad choice. PRO\\nMadison responded quickly to messages. Building was easy to find and close to public transit. Very close to a convenience stores. Appears to be security cameras. Two fairly clean bathrooms, trash was taken out. \\n\\nCON\\nThe only coffee pot was high in the cabinet and out of my reach. NO SMOKE OR FIRE ALARMS HOOKED UP. \\nThere were no sheets or pillow cases on the bed.  Our TV remotes didn\\'t have batteries.\\n\\nAll in all this is a fine crash pad  but could be really nice with a few minor touches like sheets and pillow cases on the beds and a smoke detector or two. It\\'s a small loft room that can get musty and hot in the winter (right next to a steam heater), but it\\'s in a great location at a decent price. Madison was very responsive, which was a major plus! We stayed here for four days and this place was very close to Times Square, which was great. However we smelled of a gas leaking and we had to leave because other residents told us that there may be a danger of explosion. Can\\'t beat the location and the loft was cozy. Good location! Very Clean. Communication was good. I recomend to leave the dishes visible avaiable. But I would back. I liked! Casa bene ubicata ma molto sporca. Polvere ovunque e raganatele. Peli e capelli nelle lenzuola e nei bagni. Per il resto buona ubicazione great location. close to everything. M & J responded quickly. would come back again. Die Unterkunft ist sehr schön gelegen und es hat alles sehr gut mit dem Check-in geklappt. Eine etwas laute Heizung, welche aber nicht weiter stört. Die Unterkunft ist sehr weiter zu empfehlen. Perfect location and we enjoyed our stay. We do have some comments about the place. We only got one towel each for a six days stay. Overall the place wasnt too clean. There was a lot of dust, and for example items of previous tenants, things that could be easily fixed. There also is quite a lit of noise from the heaters which could be disturbing at night. This place is great for a short stay!! Esta muy cerca de Porth Autory, genial para traslados desde cualquier aeropuerto.\\nLa cama esta en alto y hay que subir una escalera de madera, porqué esta en un altillo, apto solo para personas jóvenes.\\nPocos enchufes dentro de la habitación.\\nSi da servicio de toallas y secador de pelo.\\nEl apartamento es un 5 sin ascensor.\\nBarrio tranquilo, ninguna inseguridad, cercano a puestos de comida y farmacia.\\nCalefacción perfecta y siempre agua.\\n caliente. \\nComunicación con anfitrión siempre correcta, aunque nunca accommodation was good. On Manhattan very cheap and right in the center, I recommend. There was no insect in the apartment, we looked everywhere. We would come again. Bon emplacement. Appartement fonctionnel avec possibilité de se restaurer sur place (plus une grande supérette  au pied de l’immeuble). Propreté très limite dans la salle de bain même si celle ci dépend aussi des autres résidents... Problème (parfois) de bruit important d évacuation d air par un tuyau dans la chambre : à 6h du matin cela réveille ! Aucun pb pour accéder à l appartement lors de notre arrivée à une heure très avancée (2h du matin) grâce à la clé se trouvant dans une boite fermée par un code (reçu quelques heures avant notre arrivée) à l entrée de l immeuble. \\nN hésitez pas à vous rendre dans cette ville incroyable  ! La ubicación es excelente, se encuentra a 12 minutos caminando a Times Square, nosotros nos íbamos muy temprano por la mañana y volvíamos tarde por tanto nos ha gustado mucho. Quizá las estancias podían estar más limpias, pero en general hemos estado bien, ya que sólo íbamos a dormir y ducharnos. La comunicación con Madison es muy buena y contesta rápidamente a todo. If you want to be accessible to Times Square or the Javits Center on a budget, this place is perfect. For those who are disabled or even just over 30, be advised that there are five flights of stairs without an elevator and a ladder to the bed. For those with strong legs, it\\'s a great price for a great location. Wir haben eine Woche in dieser Unterkunft gewohnt und waren leider sehr enttäuscht. Das Badezimmer war sehr schmutzig und Schimmel war an den Decken. Sowohl im Badezimmer als auch im Schlafzimmer. Ich hab den Gastgeber kontaktiert und er wirkte sehr hilfsbereit und meinte er schaut sich das an ob die Reinigungskraft nicht gut geputzt hat, aber seiner Meinung nach war alles in Ordnung. Wenn ihre diese Unterkunft Bucht nehmt unbedingt Flipflops mit! Ich kann diese Unterkunft leider nicht weiterempfehlen. The space was exactly what I wanted, a nice place to sleep in at night while I explored the city during the day. You can\\'t beat the location, only a few blocks from Times Square! M & J\\'s place was in a great location - 5 minute walk from Times Square, subway stations and Greyhound bus station.  The room was as described, cosy!! Only issues we had were with the cleanliness of the place, and the wifi not being great in the room. Room was covered in dust and felt in need of a good clean. No hand soap in bathrooms, which were also not as clean as expected. Overall, good value and great location! El apartamento esta bastante bien, yo lo recomendaria e incluso volveria a usarlo. El unico problemilla que el aire acondicionado esta debajo de las camas y no llega bien, con lo cual se pasa un pcoo de calor en los doas calurosos. Pero todo bien. Echoing most other reviews. Great location and price. Communications were also good. They are very responsive. I would stay there again, because of the location and price. Very small room good for short stay. Not very clean, the location is good.\\nM &J gave me quick responses. Great location! Easy access to metro!  good location, not as new and fresh looking as in pics. Everything about the location was perfect for going to Javits. For the money, 110% worth it for the location. Clean bed and sheets, all good. Nice place to stay for a good price!  GREAT LOCATION!!!\\nIt was easy to find the apartment, we landed on LaGuardia airport and we took a the Subway to the apartment.  It\\'s very close to the Subway and it\\'s at the heart at Time Square. The only downside was the flight of stairs you have to take to get to the apartment, everything else was perfect. I would defiantly stay this place again in the future.  Very good location and perfect for sightseeing around Manhattan Muy cómodo y con una buena ubicación, cerca de todo This place has charm and is in a great location for lots of sight seeing and eats! We spent all day out and about walking to many locations and enjoyed the convenience of the store nearby for a quick grab.  Great place to stay would differently book again when I’m in the city. Walking distance to everything. It’s on the fifth floor just be prepared for the steps. Host were nice an friendly an responded fast.  We arrived late at night to find no key where they said it would be and unfortunately had to get a hotel as we couldn’t reach the host, however this was resolved very quickly the next day. The apartment is in a fantastic location however is quite dirty/dusty and has no products or electrical equipment available for guests to give their own room a little spring clean. Overall the exproence was pleasant and check out was very easy.  If all you\\'re looking for is a place to sleep in one of the most famous cities in the World then this is all you need. Very basic but all necessities are provided. You\\'re not going to spend much time in the room anyway. Rooms were clean! They even had a mini-fridge! The place was within walking distances to every place and even some places for a quick bite! Me and my girlfriend felt safe here! Nice room, great price near everything older NYC building. I always wanted to experience what living in in the city was like.  Thx!  location is so so nice but that\\'s it Nice small room in a really great location in the heart of NYC. Do, however, bring your own soap! Apart from that, ideal for what we needed. Great location but the cleanliness was a real disappointment. The room seemed okay but the shared areas wasn’t the nicest. Went to use the toaster one day and when I moved it a million bugs came running from underneath it. I also had a question about check out and didn’t get any response. Other than that it was an okay accommodation. Wouldn’t book again though Room was exactly as detailed on the ad. It was very hot while we were there and the air con in the room was wonderful. Appreciated that each room had a combination lock on the door so our belongings were safe. We were very happy with the location. Would stay again on our next trip to NYC. Good value if you\\'re just looking for a place to lay your head. Two of us explored on food, and it\\'s in a good area if you\\'re looking to pop in and out throughout the day Great place and location in Manhattan! Tiny cosy place in a great location. Perfect for one night travellers. Wonderful place within walking distance to the attractions we were in town to see.  Would happily stay again. Great location! Des propriétaires disponibles, et réactifs. Tout était comme annoncé. Suffisant pour la journée que je devais passer sur place Affordable place to stay. Not the same as in pictures but manageable. The keys were not available until 7pm when the check in time is 2pm. If this happens to you, try to contact the host through Airbnb messaging system. Don’t call or text the cell phone listed in the listing. You will get no response. Die Lage der Wohnung ist super. Das Zimmer sehr klein und mit einem Hochbett nicht wirklich schön. Die Hygiene und Sauberkeit lässt sehr zu wünschen übrig, damit meine ich kleine tierische Mitbewohner im Schlafzimmer, Staub und Dreck (Haare usw) sowohl im Schlafzimmer als auch im Badezimmer. An den Decken finden sich in den Badezimmern und leider auch bei uns im Zimmer Flecken, die sehr nach Schimmelbefall aussehen. Die Kommunikation mit den Vermietern war gut. Wir würden aufgrund des Hygienemangels ,auch wenn der Preis sehr günstig war, nicht noch einmal dieses Zimmer buchen und würden es auch keinem empfehlen. Location is perfect for visiting NYC.  Everything is within a short walking distance.  Price is great too. Michael was very sympatic with us and really helpful.\\r\\nThe apartment is well located, really close to Brodway jonction subway station, 20 min from Manhattan.\\r\\nIt s a good plan if you are looking for a cheap accomodation in NYC!\\r\\n Very nice host\\nNeighbourgs a bit noisy\\nPerfect for a cheap week-end in NYC Michael was very helpful and accommodating for our stay. He made the whole process very easy for us! Good value for the stay and convenient to all of Brooklyn and getting back to Manhattan. The apartment building was a little loud but it was Halloween anyway :) Great place for the money. Convenient to the Subway Perfect for the price and convenient to the subway. Michael was very helpful and check in on me during my stay. He was also very flexible and allowed me to extend my reservation. Michael\\'s place was great. He was great and made me feel very welcome. This is a great place if you are looking for a comfortable place to lay your head Solid place to stay. Host was very helpful, would book again. Michael was a great host. Place was clean, perfect for my weekend get a way. Michael is a wonderful host and made an effort to help and make me feel welcomed. The location is very convenient for commuting to the city as it is very close to Broadway Junction subway station. I recommend this as a low-cost option for sleeping in Brooklyn. Just note that the neighbors may be a bit noisy. Michael was a very awesome host. He made a lot of efforts to solve any problems I had, like helping me carry my luggage from the subway station. He also replied to my messages quickly enough during my stay.\\r\\nThe apartment was on the ground floor and looked exactly like the pictures. All the facilities (heating, hot water, WiFi, kitchen, etc.) worked well and Michael prepared a lot of useful things in the kitchen and the bathroom for me to use. Going to Manhattan from the apartment was quite convenient, although it usually took about 30 minutes. The only negative thing was that the neighbors were playing really loud music for the very first nights, however I told Michael about it and he talked to the neighbors. After that it was better.\\r\\nThe streets around the apartment were really dirty with a lot of trash. On the way to the Broadway Junction subway station, I had to go through a tunnel which has a horrible smell. I was a bit scared by the neighborhood when I arrived because I thought it would be unsafe. But nothing bad ever happened to me, so it\\'s fine :)\\r\\nOverall, this is a very nice and economical place to stay in New York City.  Great little place to stay close to the Atlantic Ave train station. Michael was very accommodating and stayed to show us around the apartment. Although the neighbors can be a bit loud, I would definitely recommend this place for a nice visit. Points positif : Hôte sympatique qui à guider notre chauffeur de taxi à destination,\\r\\nMichael nous à expliquer où était le métro.\\r\\n- Métro proche + petite épicerie\\r\\n\\r\\nPoints négatif ( beaucoup) : ne correspond pas vraiment au photos\\r\\n- Odeur de \"pas propre\" à notre entrée même en ouvrant les fenêtres toute la journée le soir en rentrant c\\'était pareil\\r\\n- PETITS CAFARDS qui se baladaient \\r\\n- VOISINS très bruyant musique tôt le matin jusqu\\'à tard la nuit !\\r\\n- plusieurs déchets poser partout ( bouteille d\\'alcool, gobelet..)\\r\\n- lit hyper mou ( j\\'ai encore mal au dos après 1 semaine) \\r\\n\\r\\nbref personne sympatique mais appart INSALUBRE je ne recommande pas même si c\\'était le moins cher du quartier\\r\\n\\r\\n The apartment is as described on the pictures and was well equipped.\\r\\nMichael answered us to all questions immediatly.\\r\\nThe apartment is close to the subway station Broadway Junction from where you can get easily to the city and to JFK airport.\\r\\n Nice place to stay. Michael was there to meet my wife and I and provided everything we needed to make our stay as comfortable as possible. He was easy to reach in case I had any questions or concerns. Would definitely consider staying there again when we\\'re in town. We felt extremely well welcomed! He was there when we arrived and got us settled wonderfully with everything we needed. Michael was super helpful and allowed us to book super last minute. He was very accommodating and friendly. The host was ready to welcome us even though we were a little late. The space was a little cold by every effort was made to make us comfortable! Wifi worked great! Good location near a deli for food! Great place. Great host. 5 stars I felt just at home here. I like to visit often. Great experience. Great location - less than an 8 minute walk to the A train that takes you into the city. Local shop nearby that sells snacks, hot food and has an ATM (it charges tho). It was a bit dirty but nothing that couldn\\'t be handled in 2 minutes. Great space for me and my partner ^_^ Had a good time. No major problems, other than the weather (which we couldn\\'t control, although we tried). Very kind, let me stay an extra night to take my time leaving. Michael was a great host. He was very attentive and the listing description was accurate. The property was clean and accessible.  It was very cozy my boyfriend and I original booked for one night but loved it so much that we decided to book for two more nights. Perfect for two people. Near great transportation and the Wi-Fi was fast and great. Michael was attentive and made sure you were at home. He also made check-in and check-out very simple - despite how late into the night I checked in.  Wife: Host was very friendly and accomidating. He did not rush us out nor did he rush us to check in. Room was private, clean, comfy. Shower had a great flow. I had a great night sleep in that bed. Due to not being rushed out I was able to take a shower and take my time getting dress. We would definitely love he\\'s business again.  For the price, it was a great place to stay! The neighborhood felt a little unsafe at first, but nothing of note happened while we were there. The apartment was small but clean, and the bed was very clean and comfortable. The back door was convenient for ventilation, but the back area was hilariously sketchy. If you\\'re on a budget but still want an entire apartment as a home base, definitely rent from Michael! He is always available, very flexible, and will make sure your stay is as comfortable as it can be! Michael explained the whole room and was great.  Close to the metro, and everything we needed. Some neighbors were noisy during the night but that\\'s all. Thank You!! Michael is a very hospitable and friendly host and the apartment is accurate to his pictures. We had a great stay! Michael was very flexible and kind.  He met me with the keys even though it was a holiday and I arrived later than expected.  He made sure to show how everything worked and made himself available when ever I might need him.  I felt at home immediately.  The neighborhood was generally quiet and everyone was very friendly.  It was extremely close to the subway and train which was fantastic for getting around and enjoying the city.  I really enjoyed my time there. Michael was super accommodating and helpful regarding our travel plans. The accommodations are minimal but convenient to subway/LIRR/JFK.  He went out of his way and allowed us to stow our luggage in another location while we trekked around the city before departing. We look forward to staying again!\\r\\n Michael was nice and friendly host. His apartment is nothing fancy but it is ideal for budget travellers who want to have private accomodation in Brooklyn. It is very close to public transport and has very comfortable bed.  The house was just as described and everything went smoothly. Neighborhood seemed a little sketchy but we were just fine. Very close to the train and the Wi-Fi, bed, and tv were all fine. Great for people on a budget.  My visit was decent, loud neighbors but comfortable bed. The neighborhood though, is a little sketchy.  Michael was a great host.\\r\\nThe flat is ideally located between JFK and Manhattan. There are several subway lines available and the station is very close by foot.\\r\\nthe room is basic, we tend to hear the neighbours but it\\'s a good option if like us you\\'re only staying in the flat to sleep and shower.  Michael was helpful and friendly and made me feel welcome. The listing was accurate. Michael was very welcoming and friendly. Even though we didn\\'t see him but he always responded promptly. \\r\\nThe apartment was clean. Unfortunately we saw a mice there and because my wife is very much afraid of mice we immediately left the apartment. \\r\\nNeighborhood was not bad. The neighbors were very noisy.  Subway station was about 2 minutes walking distance.  Michael, fue muy atento y servicial. Michael was really amazing! The moment we got to the listing. We were a little nervous because we were two young girls from the country in NC. So a big city was pretty intimidating. Michael was super welcoming and made sure that we knew we would be safe and taken care of. He allowed us to text him and call in if we had any issues or problems and he was so willing to answer and take time to help us. We stayed for two nights and even though it was deep into Brooklyn. We had a blast. The room looked exactly like the listing. We really liked the computer he has in the room. It was useful for looking up things to do in NYC. The place was clean and the neighbors were a little loud but we expected that from NYC. As two young girls trying to take over the city, Michael made it effortless and we would stay with him again. He was super sweet and caring. For the price and Michael, this place is a complete deal. You will not regret it.  Michael was there to let me in when I arrived. Apartment is v basic, but as described. Great internet connection. I enjoyed my stay at this place. Its got the essentials like the internet, kitchen, and bathroom. I think because I stayed in so many places, I personally don\\'t mind the location and the state of the place (it\\'s not a hotel!). Highly recommended if you need somewhere to stay for a night to relax before you go somewhere else next. The place was clean and homey. The host was very receptive and reliable.  We came in late and he was outside waiting for us to let us in. I would definitely recommend this place. Michael was a great host!! Very accommodating!!! Made me feel very welcomed and secured. The listing is exactly as described.The place was perfect for an adventure in Brooklyn. It is walking distance from the Broadway Junction which takes you to JFK, Manhattan, Brooklyn Bridge and connections to Queens and the Bronx, I mean basically wherever I wanted to go. The place is clean and perfect for a single person or couple. A roomy bedroom, kitchen and bathroom for that price, you just cant beat it. The bed was  comfortable. He offers towels, blankets, sheets, cups and pots for cooking. The apartment comes with a tv and internet. Wifi is fantastic and the air conditioning was  perfect for hot Brooklyn Days. I was able to really experience the feel of Brooklyn. Safe neighborhood, cool and protective neighbors and walking distance from beautiful Brooklyn murals of Spike Lee, Questlove, and Mos Def. I ended up needing to stay an extra night and Michael booked me without hesitation.  Overall I had a great time, felt safe and will definitely stay again. 何と言っても値段が安いです｡駅は近いですが､夜間は警戒が必要です｡ﾎｽﾄのﾏｲｹﾙはﾁｪｯｸｲﾝも飛行機が遅れたにもかかわらず快く待っていてくれてｽﾑｰｽﾞな対応でした｡ Great host as always very welcoming and hepful Michael was quick with responses and action. When we were unclear with communication of check in, Michael did his best to adjust to our schedules and helped our move go smoothly. Though the place is small, the things Michael provided (essentials and wifi) made up for it.  Good place to stay for that short time - everything worked out just fine. TY I booked Michaels place for one night.  The problem was it was on a Weekend and the subay right next to the apartment was not working so it was a bit complicated to go somewhere. We decidet to stay in the apartment to drink something and order pizza. There was a grocery store right next to the apartment but no restaurant or something where we could get something to eat. (Hidden by Airbnb) maps said the next restaurant is 1h walking away. We tryed to order pizza or so but they said the don\\'t deliver there where we live.  So we searched something and after 30 min walking we found a pizza place and more 10 min we found a chines place. When you do that in the night maybe it\\'s better to to that not alone.. Didn\\'t looked soo save around there. But i think during the week it\\'s super bice to sleep there. As i said, it\\'s right next to a subway so you can reach everything very easy. The apartment is old but it have a TV with internet connection, you have free wifi and a air conditioner! That was awsome because it was soo freaky hot outside. The smell was ok after you sprayes the room spay because ther live a dog in the house upstairs and you can smell him everywhere. But all in all we had a very nice weekend there. And michael was really nice! We called him and said that we are there soon so he gave us the keys and showed us everything in the aparment (how it works,..). That was nice. Room was just as advertised.. Simple, yet effective. I arrived with my wife and two boys and was able to get in the house at 6am. Room was perfect . About 3 minutes to subway for the L train and 2 minutes from the long Island Railroad stop. Thanks for the great experience! The apartment was as promised and had some nice features, towls, computer, dishes. Its is very close to a major MTA train station which is nice. The neighborhood however is not for the faint of heart. Gentrification has not reached this part of Brooklyn and may not for some time, so if your looking for some hipster haven, go else where. \\nMore about the apt.; it does have vermin, and lots of them. the place was filled with dozen of moth balls which were used to drive of mice and rats which Michael told me could come in from the nasty storage space just off the bedroom. There were also many roaches, caught a huge one in a glass before I left. \\nAll in all, the place was worth the price and Michael was very nice. Good for a one night stay Cozy, comfortable space. Mike was very friendly. Friend and I had a nice time overall Annonce mensongère, appartement insalubre, présence de cafard, forte odeur de solvant persistante malgré une aération quotidienne.. La vaisselle était sale des notre arrivée, les draps salle ainsi que le linge de toilette et je ne vous parle pas du quartier ou l\\'on peut croiser un homme en sang venant de se faire poignarder à quelques pas de l\\'entrée du bâtiment.. \\r\\nDurant notre absence il y a de forte chance que quelqu\\'un soit rentrer dans l\\'appartement, aucune de nos affaires n\\'a été touché mais nous avons trouvé l\\'ordinateur allumé.\\r\\nDes zonard dans la cage d\\'escalier le soir qui se bourre la gueulle. \\r\\nSeule point positif, l\\'accès internet et la proximité du métro. Cependant comptez plus 40 min que 20 min pour atteindre Manhattan.  it is not the nicest nbhoods. but there are 3 supermarkets within 5 mins reach with ATM service. theres a 24/7 you walk by every time you come from the sub-\\r\\nthe building is nice like a lot in the nbhood and the nbs we met were always very nice :D\\r\\nthe apt is not the nicest. we were missing a coffee maker but thats NYC - you get a coffee to go. its good for a sleep ( be aware the bed is comfy but noisey lol)\\r\\nmichael is a great host who even picked us up after our internet went down and we were lost\\r\\nthe only very bad thing about the apt is the smell - you spray when you come in and then forget about it. but you will bring it home! beside the VERY BAD SMELL its a great stay Exactly as expected! Not the most spacious or in the best neighborhood, but was perfect for two for a weekend.  He was friendly and very informative and attentive  Micheal is a gracious host,  and the room/apt is cozy and with useful amenities.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood value overall for a spot in Brooklyn. Everything went smoothly, and the stay was more pleasant than expected as everything was clean and we had all the amenities we needed. We came as a group of 4 and was able to make space to stay and sleep comfortably. It was cool We did not expect much for the price that we paid. The place is enough for two people. There is a very strong smell from cleaning products. The neighborhood was a bit scary, wouldn\\'t recommend walking alone at night. To get to manhattan is about 30-40 min by subway. Overall it was ok, especially if you are not very fussy:)) Michael\\'s place had all the basics, with solid Internet, a baseboard heater you can adjust, and complimentary blood-bank flip-flops. The Atlantic stop on the L line seems to be closest.\\n Michael was very friendly, check in and check out were uncomplicated. The appartement is located near two subway stations, thus it is pretty easy discovering New York. We´ve had a great time. Close to the Subway station, the description is very accurate. Everything was uncomplicated L\\'appartement est très bien situé, proche de deux stations de métro allant toutes deux à Manhattan. Le logement est propre et bien équipé, idéal pour un couple. Le voisinage et Michael sont très aimables et arrangeants. Nous avons passé un séjour de 18 jours très agréable It was great. Convenient accommodation. Great host. Communication was excellent.  Michael\\'s place is cozy and comfortable. The location is very close to L train and there is a 24 hour grocery store nearby. No need to get scared of reaching home late night as the neighborhood is safe and secure. Michael would effectively communicate with you regarding any issues and he even helped us with our baggage problem on the last minute. Don\\'t miss to stay in this excellent place hosted by gem of a kind person when you visit Brooklyn. Small but comfortable, fresh towels and good wifi! Not the best neighborhood but it was suitable  La ubicación es buena pues está cerca del metro L, con la que se puede llegar a Manhattan en media hora, pero no es tan segura y agradable como esperábamos. La limpieza del lugar fue aceptable, pero no más que eso. Algo que no nos agradó fue que por las noches se filtraba humo de cigarrillo y marihuana que fumaban los vecinos a través de la calefacción. Sin embargo, todo lo demás es adecuado y como lo describe el anuncio. The place was as described, a lot cleaner than we expected and more space than most apartments in NY Michael is a great host, he let us check in early and check out at a later time. The place has everything you need, the location is convenient, the subway station is walking distance. However, the neighbors are loud at night and we had trouble accessing hot water in the morning. Thank you for hosting us!  MY 18k GOLD RING WAS STOLEN!!!! I BOOKED THIS PLACE FOR THREE DAYS AND AT FIRST EVERYTHING WAS RUNNING SMOOTH AND I WAS LOOKIN FORWARD TO BOOKIN IN THE FUTURE BUT ON MY LAST NIGHT STAY THERE EVERYTHING WENT LEFT...I LEFT THE HOUSE THINKING I LOVKED THE KEYS IN THE HOUSE SO J CALLED THE HOST TELLIN HIM IM LOCKED OUT AND ASKED IF HE COULD COME LET ME IN OR COME OPEN THE DOOR HE AGREED AND SAID TO CALL HIM ON MY WAY BACK..I FOUND THE KEYS COUPLE MINUTES LATER IN MY POCKET BUT WAS TOO BUSY CALLJNG BANKS JOBS AND DOIN ERRANDS TO CALL HIM AND TELL HIM I FOUND TGE KEY...I CAME BACK TO THE DOOR OPEN AND A MISSIN RING THT I KNOWWWW I PUTBY THE BATHROOM SINK SAFE ENOUGH IT COULDNT FALL...AND EITHER WAY THE HOLE IN THE SINK IS BLOCKEDD SO IT CANT FIT..SO I CALLED HIM AND TOLD HIM WHAT HAPPENED THT MY 18k GOLD RING WAS BY THE SINK NOW ITS MISSING..FIRST HE LIED ABOUT SECURITY FOOTAGE...AND THERES NO CAMERA AT ALL NEITHER IN APARTMENT BULDING LOBBY NIT EVEN ON THE (Website hidden by Airbnb) ONTOP OF LYING HE KEPT AVOIDING CALLS AND TEXT All The WayYY TO THE NEXT MORNING WHEN I CALLED HIM AND TOLD HIM IM GETTING POLICE INVOLVED HE HUNG UP ON ME!

STILL CANNOT BELIEVE IT... Für eine Nacht als Notlösung in Ordnung. Great host, very hospitable and communicates with guests  Michael\\'s space is just what I needed after a long day of driving. It\\'s got what you need. All I require is a bed and a bathroom. It had both. Would love to stay with again if in the area. Price was better than any hotel as well. \\n\\nThanks for letting this road warrior lay his head down for a few zzzzzzzzzz Close to the train station  Not the cleanest but not very private  Bang for your buck Worth every penny! Great value Great value for money, and only a few minutes walk from the subway. Cute place, very private and comfortable. Micheal is nice and you can tell cares about his guests.  Check in time was delayed which was a problem coming from out of state. We planned to arrive at 11 after that was what Michael told us. We were told to arrive at 2:30 he didn\\'t show up until 3 then had to clean the apartment until 3:30. Comfortable small apartment, great value. The neighborhood seems sketchy at first but everyone kinda minds their own business. The subway is very close and it\\'s about a 30 min ride to Manhattan, you can go anywhere fro\\nm the L by connecting to other trains. All together it was a nice stay.  Perfect place to stay  La casa de Michael es de facil acceso desde el subway. El vecindario es recidencial.  Es acorde a su descripción. Es un lugar cómodo y económico.  This place is super inexpensive and was perfect for us. Me and my boyfriend stayed and didn\\'t mind it at all. The place was clean, plenty of space for you and another, and was very cheap so it saved us a ton of money to spend in the city! As long as you don\\'t mind a short walk to the subway, then you are good. We had to plan our showers though, as the building shares one water heater but that wasn\\'t a big deal. The neighbors would make noise but wouldn\\'t complain if we were maki g the same amount of noise so that also wasn\\'t a bother to us. We got in later than expected for check-in but Michael worked with us and was so helpful and friendly. He has your best interest! We will be staying here again once we come back to the city! It was perfect for us. The stay was great. Michael was a great host and provided everything you could need.  Not the prettiest of places, but affordable and on a direct subway line to the city and JFK The appartment was Ok but the neighbourhood felt a bit unsafe. Not recomended to children\\n Michael was very welcoming and easy to deal with. Very nice location for someone who is comfortable with talking with all types of people, very diverse area and I liked it a lot. Super close to a train that takes you straight to manhattan and it\\'s only about a 15 minute ride. Neighbors are very friendly and helpful. Would definitely come again!  Cheap, cool place. Thanks! First off, please speak with Michael directly (don\\'t text) BEFORE you come to check in, because I texted him about my arrival time a day before and he was still late for check in, and this is Brownsville (the worst part of town) so no one wants to be standing around waiting, the linen smelled like urine but other then that I enjoyed my stay in the hood due to the private apt Michael is awesome and the place is cozy. I definitely recommend staying here for a cheap option. Michael est un hôte excellent. Il nous arranger pour notre départ en partant plus tard de l\\'appartement. Le quartier est bien le metro à coté. \\nLappartement est simple et pratique. Le lit super!!  Michael was very nice and accomodating Not a big place but stay  was good Perfect for the price! Michael is really nice and friendly. Free parking on the street. I am definitely staying there again. Great place to stay, a little confusing to get to. Good value for your money.  Place is exactly as pictured. Has everything you need for a simple overnight stay. Michael nos recibió con mucha amabilidad y cortesía, la llegada fue perfecta.  ya que con vuelo de España fue difícil de estimar la llegada y nosotros sin teléfono de EEUU, Michael nos esperó sin problemas por la noche lo que hiciera falta.  Nos mostró el funcionamiento del apartamiento (tv con muchos extras, aire acondicionado, agua, electricidad, perchero, cocina equipada, toallas limpias, baño incluso con jabones y mucho papel higiénico sin necesidad de comprarlo) y no tuvimos ningún problema durante nuestra estancia en ningún momento, todo estuvo perfecto, es tal cual como publicado y la comunicación con Michael fue perfecta. Michael es el dueño y todo el edificio le respeta. Un lugar económico en la carísima NY de privacidad total sin tener que compartir cocina/baño etc. con nadie y con muchas conexiones de transporte público al lado mismo para donde sea,- parada de metro casi al lado de la casa, con los metros L y A se llega bastante rápido a Manhattan sin tener que hacer trasbordo ninguno, incluso alli mismo hay un tren de cercanías rápido y muy cómodo a Long Island y otros lugares más lejanos, lo hemos aprovechado todo.  Muchas gracias por todo, Michael! Michaels rental was a great inexpensive place to crash for a couple days while driving around and visiting people and places in Brooklyn. It was clean, easy and not pretentious. Had everything you might need for a short stay. Quick walk from Broadway Junction or the L at Atlantic. What was good was the price wifi worked well. Host was prompt. The place is small but big enough for one person. What I didn\\'t like was the overall stale smell that hits you every time you walk in. The air conditioner is so loud it woke me up several times but worst of all there were ppl who hang out in the hallway right by the door to the apt and they smoke and the smell comes into the apartment strongly, it got so bad and strong in the apartment that I had to ask them to please stop, I didn\\'t even know if I had the right to do that but my nostrils were stuffing up.  Great stay if you want to have a cheap place to see and experience New York.\\nEasy travelling to Manhattan and a few 24hr shops closeby. Michaels place is very affordable. Michael is a very nice person! The apartment was overbooked and he organized us another apartment which was not far away from the original booked accommodation. All in all I can recommend this host for short term rentals.  Privacy was great. Great value and great host. You get a bedroom, a kitchen and a bathroom. What else could you need? Easy walk to the subway. Grocery stores and delis throughout the neighborhood. Chatty locals. An affordable stay with free Roku and wi-fi. k Not worth the money!!! Coffee stains on the bed that were new and water was leaking from the roof! The guy who let me in was also rude and kind of odd Awesome place. Thanks Michael! Excelente custo beneficio. Mala ventilación del lugar, insectos en todo el departamento.\\nLas almohadas eran muy duras al igual que la cama, que además se hunde en el medio. El marco de la puerta está rota y da la impresión que con un empujón se abrirá.\\nLos vecinos fueron amables pero por las noches todos escuchan a todos, paredes y techos muy delgados. La limpieza muy mala.\\nMichael fue muy amable y su wi-fi estupendo. La hubicacion es buena, hay un almacén cerca y el metro está a 5 minutos caminando. You get exactly what you pay for, it\\'s cheap and perfect for a short stay in the city. Public transit is easily accessible and the place has all the basic amenities you will need. Michael was a great host, good at communicating. He always checked up to see if everything was okay. It was a great stay! Very easy to find. Michael was super friendly. I would certainly use this location again. Wszystko zgodnie z opisem! Dziękujemy za pobyt! Great value but it looks like a tough neighborhood on outside but people are real nice.  Michael was nice and checked me in on time. Great house,great stay,great host Great stay for this money Micheal è stato molto disponibile dal check in al check out. Ha tenuto le nostre valigie oltre l\\'orario del check out. La casa è a 5 minuti dalla metropolitana ma di sera la strada non sembra molto sicura. La serratura della porta andrebbe cambiata e l\\'appartamento ha bisogno di una bella pulita, abbiamo trovato alcuni insetti. \\nIn conclusione il maggiore problema è la pulizia, ma se si passa la giornata fuori e considerando il prezzo e la posizione, ne vale la pena.  ﾏｲｹﾙはとても感じがよく､いいﾎｽﾄでした｡家では､同じｱﾊﾟｰﾄの住人の音楽が夜中もうるさかったです｡上の階の足音や生活音が下の階にすごく響いた｡時間帯によってｼｬﾜｰのお湯が出なくなる時があった｡天井からの水漏れがあったようで､帰宅したらﾍﾞｯﾄﾞが濡れていたが夜にも関わらずﾎｽﾄがすぐにﾁｪｯｸしに来てくれた｡駅からは近いが､慣れるまでは少し怖いと思うかも知れません｡ Great host, lock was tricky but he had a neighbour let us in the building. Key does work but is a bit difficult. Great value. Loved how it was an entire place that had all that was necessary and more. Bon emplacement pour très court séjour metro pas loin ligne A C Quiet, Serves The Purpose, Clean...Wish There Were More Food Options Around Though. Accomodation was quite good equal to price. Bed was good,water was hot. Close to subway.For few nights stay is really okej. Clean, cozy apartment. I had a great stay here and you just can\\'t beat the value. Great place for the price!! Heater was weak but enjoyed the stay Wir wollten 10 Tage in der Unterkunft bleiben und haben uns nach der 1. Nacht eine neue Unterkunft gesucht. Die Heizung war viel zu schwach und der Heizlüfter der uns empfohlen wurde schaltete sich nach 30 Minuten aus. Michael empfahl uns den Herd anzumachen für mehr Wärme. Gerade in der Nacht sind Herd und Heizlüfter keine Möglichkeiten zum Heizen. Es gab auch keine richtigen Decken so dass unsere einzige Nacht der Horror war. Die Tagesdecke sah sehr keimig aus. Das Bad konnte man gar nicht beheizen und es hatte dort nur 12 Grad. Das Bett war durchgelegen, hat nur geknarzt und auch die Küchenschränke waren teils kaputt. Wir waren froh eine neue Unterkunft beziehen zu können die wir uns vor Ort selbst gesucht haben. It\\'s livable but not a place you want to spend much time in. Bring your own sheets and some RAID for the roaches. You\\'re paying 50$ a night to stay in new york, you get what you pay for. House was amazingg Good Good place Brakowało pościeli, było zimno, ogólnie niezbyt czysto, łazienka w pełni wyposażona ale zimna, drzwi od łazienki nie domykały się, wifi, telewizor bardzo dobre. Dzwonek do drzwi nie działa. Okolica to typowy Brooklyn, nie ma rewelacji ale blisko lotniska. Worked well for what we needed! Great place for two people to go if they aren’t going to spend much time there other than resting/sleeping! Really appreciated the Free Netflix! Thanks Michael, the place was nice and warm and was easy to find and I would stay again. Relatively good place to stay but definitively not in winter because the room was very cold even though there were heaters. And it’s rather far away from Manhattan Michael was really nice and helping! The apartment is good Good price and great access to the subway! Michael made sure we had plenty of heating during this particularly cold period. Get what you pay for It Was A Nice Clean Place To Stay.. Great place, would definitely recommend. Great place and a lovely Bathroom  go there by yourself or with your shawty total privacy, for this price make your wanna stay the whole week Great for couples or being by yourself You get what you pay for. Comfortable spot, uncomfortable odor. very nice and helpful Great place. Would stay again. A suitable flat for a couple, nearby metro, bus and train connections. Michael was a friendly host. ‘‘Twas lit Hinta-laatusuhde hyvä. Metroasema lyhyen kävelymatkan päässä, joten yhteydet kaupunkiin hyvät ja helpot. Talo oli hieman äänekäs, mutta ihmiset,  joita kohdattiin olivat ystävällisiä. Aivan lähellä myös pieniä ruokakauppoja. Asunto on vanha ja monin osin kaipaisi remonttia. Ikkunat olivat peitetyt muovilla ilmeisesti vedon estämiseksi, joten ulos ei nähnyt asunnosta. Tietojemme mukaan alueella on hieman rauhaton ja levoton maine, mutta me emme kohdanneet ongelmia viiden päivän majoittumisemme aikana. Olimme tyytyväisiä. Pieni asunto vastasi meidän tarpeisiin ja oli viihtyisä. Siinä pääsi mukaan myös kaupungin tunnelmaan eri tavalla kuin ehkä hotellissa asuen. Sänky oli hyvä. Michael oli asiallinen ja joustava. Best Airbnb experience I had! Overall ok for the price if you don’t mind cigarette smell and cold water for the shower Great spot be back soon 2nd time staying here and it was great ! exactly as pictured. Netflix was nice touch . good place to rest for the night! Place was valid Great deal Great little place that\\'s close to the city with a subway station right outside. Great place Loved the neighborhood. Felt right at home. Nice place to stay for a night in the city Nice host, but the bed was too hard and cold for me because of poor isolation in the room It was a good place if you’re looking for a quick stay for one day. Place smells old and needs to be cleaned up  It’s ok for the price A++ You get what you pay for  You get what you pay for. Exactly as seen in pictures despite a few roaches here and there. Netflix was a nice touch. Place was very well air conditioned. Only down side neighborhood was very rough. Great stay It’s not too out of place. Honestly I would never sleep there, I didn’t feel comfortable with the extra guests (roaches) and the pillows or sheets didn’t look very clean. There was also a pretty bad odor in the kitchen. Could tidy up a lot more. I hope your home progresses in a great way. Great stay If you\\'re flying solo and don\\'t need a big space, this is a perfect crash pad for visit NYC for the weekend.  Decent place for budget travelers.\\n La zona no es segura, hay mala gente, no salir de noche, nos robaron. Para ir del metro al apartamento hay que pasar por un pasaje, que los propios vecinos de la zona pasaban corriendo aterrorizados. Decidimos cancelar aunque perdimos dinero antes de que pasara algo más grave. Ademas el apartamento estaba sucio, en especial el baño. Nada recomendable. Good near by train station I enjoyed my stay Micheal is a great host Value Spot you get what you pay for Very convenient location - trains to various places in NYC within a walking distance Good cheap closer subway but it\\'s not a good area. Always a pleasure  to stay some where that feels like home.  It is always peace and quiet. Reasonable house Great place to stay. Neighborhood has everything you\\'ll need and really close to a lot of different subway lines. It\\'s kind of far from Manhattan but for a price that low honestly it\\'s understandable. It\\'s a good option for someone looking to save money on their visit to NYC. location to subway was ideal.   i didnt get to enjoy that due to maintenance on track every night i was there.   but very safe neighborhood,  didnt seem but dont be mistaken.   it was safer than my hometown and i had to experience it.   very much safe n helpful, friendly ppl around.   i would definitely book again.   Felt like a local and had everything i needed.   great affordable stay.  Even when trains changed and complicated traveling,   this place was a quick walk and never had a worry. No the cleanest place if he cleans it maybe it will be a good place to spend one night Great place to stay to crash for a night or two. For under $60 I’d say this is a pretty decent place to stay in Brooklyn. The apartment was clean it just had a slight odor which wasn’t really a problem for my guest and I but it was present. It was close to a few deli’s which came in handy for midnight snacks. The train is also close by if you’re looking to explore New York. Micheal is nice and arranging but the neighborhood is not really reassuring. One window is broken and there is a curtain to plug the hole. The last night of our stay we had to kill a cockroach and there are barely enough plates and cutlery for two people (half of it is plastic). There is a light in the kitchen that you can\\'t switch off, unless you unscrew the light bulb (there is obviously no door between the room and the kitchen). The place is quite dirty (mold and dust) and doors are hard to open/close. The only good point is the closeness to the metro station which takes you to upper manhattan in around 40 minutes. I had a great time in Michaels apartment! The value for the price is definitely unbeatable. So much worth it. Easy access, private and fairly quiet for New York City. It is not of course the top luxurious apartment, but there is more than all you need for a good quality stay. It was exactly what I was looking for. \\n\\nMichael was very responsive and helpful at all times on the telephone. \\n  \\nI read some previous negative reviews and I can say that for my experience, the smell was good (I didn\\'t smell cigarettes at all), and I didn\\'t see any cockroach the entire week. \\n\\nThank you again Michael and I would definitely come back! :-) It is a no frills stay with a comfortable bed,  wifi, and a TV in the room I was in which also locks. I just needed to crash so my requirements weren\\'t many. Michael was responsive and flexible. So, this place is a steal.  It’s nothing fancy, but why would you need fancy when you’re close to a metro that will take you anywhere in NYC?!?  Well worth your dollar and very easy communication with Michael.  Everything that i needed was already here (towels, shower stuff, cooking equipment, etc.) The good cheap place if you need somewhere to sleep. Close to subway. Great Host It\\'s cool, host didn\\'t hover. great for the price! it’s a perfect place to sleep after a night in the city, check in and check out was easy the place was extremely lackluster. there was no heat. we asked for heat.and there was never a response in that regard. I never got back to this place ever again. Highly Recommended! Jeannie was a great host! She is very communicative and understanding. The home was comfy and clean. Jeannie\\'s place was absolutely perfect - great location, comfortable and clean. It was very easy to communicate and check-in. We loved how close her apartment was to the museums and Central Park. There is a lot to do and see within walking distance of her place, so definitely worth the value. It was nice to have a full kitchen and the shower pressure and heat were wonderful (simple things when it\\'s FREEZING outside, right?). Jeannie, thank you so much! Jeannie was fantastic and always available if we had questions or concerns. Would definitely stay again. Be sure to confirm ALL facts re: apt (ie listed amenities, exact location, etc) prior to checking in.  That said, the apt and the neighborhood were both nice and a good quality for the price (aside from the lack of functional television)  Also, Jeannie was very friendly and easy to deal with, as well as very accommodating as far as our last minute booking and off-hour check-in time following a Broadway play. Had a great stay at this place! Fantastic hot shower, super clean and comfortable. \\nGood place to spend the night missing some details of kitchen equipment that can be improved and were already suggested. Also make clear the arrival instructions to avoid last-minute changes that being on the trip is preferable to avoid Cute NYC Apt., great location and wonderful hostess. Jeannie made us feal like we were at home.  Great location, great price and great host ! Pros: SO CLEAN. Excellent location. Good food nearby. \\n\\nCon (only one): The apartment listed in this post is not the apartment I was sent to. In fact, the only photo that belongs to the apartment I was sent to, is the couch/table photo. \\n\\nEven despite the location issue, I would stay here again. It\\'s not far off from where the itinerary had their location listed, and it includes all of the amenities that are on this page. The check in/check out process was a lot easier than I thought it would be, given the fact that it is New York. Overall a great experience. Please note that the photos listed and address provided for this apartment are not accurate. We had multiple complaints of cleanliness problems, and the bed and sofa/futon bed are unfortunately quite uncomfortable (we were unable to stay both nights). Jeannie was, however, quite responsive to our complaints and quickly arranged to have one night reimbursed to us. Really clean and cozy place, close to lots of restaurants and a short walk from the East River, which was great! Great and prompt communication with Jenny! Great location. Close to the subway station and easy to get to other places in the city from here. Very clean and comfortable apartment! This place was like a fancy hotel room. Great comfortable bed in the bedroom with a futon in the living room, clean bathroom and kitchen. I can’t picture staying anywhere else every time I come t NYC. This is a small and clean apartment on a quiet street in the Upper East Side. It is close to several subway lines as well as a cross town bus to the Upper West Side. One pleasant surprise was the farmers market right across the street on Saturday morning.\\nAs one would expect in Manhattan the apartment is smaller than one bedroom apartments in other US cities. We were three people, two parents and one daughter, and the apartment was manageable but tight for us. The kitchen and living room are the same room, with no kitchen table or chairs. The bedroom is separated from the living room with a sliding door with windows. The two beds were separated by about twelve inches. So it definitely works for three people but not if they need privacy or have different sleep schedules. The kitchen is sparsely furnished with limited cookware. \\nThe photos in the listing are of a different apartment of the same size and basic pattern. We have encouraged the host to produce a separate listing for each apartment she rents. Jenny was accommodating, however, the apartment we stayed in was different than what was advertised online.  The real unit is about a block or so away. There is one bed (not the greatest) and one futon (also not the greatest). There was no garbage can, and not enough utensils to cook a proper meal in the kitchen.\\n\\nWe were surprised that we had to wait in a nearby pizza restaurant until the landlords went back inside - I guess we weren\\'t supposed to be renting for the night/weekend? Great spot and location. Highly recommended I loved how Jenny’s place was very close to subway entrances. It made it very easy to get to many places. The place was quiet and the bed was very comfortable. Jenny was quick to respond to our reservation request &  the questions we had.  This apartment was not what we originally contracted so we had no idea what we were getting.  Paid parking was down the block. It was not as \\'free & available\\'  as we were led to believe. Also, we were told there would be breakfast, but there was not.   We needed to leave a day early due to a death in our family   We were not reimbursed for the 1 day, despite our request and all the changes made. We had a lovely stay at Jenny’s apartment. It was the perfect size for two people for just a short stay in the city. The apartment was very clean and we were provided with bedding, towels, and kitchenware to use during our visit. Only complaint was that the pictures were not completely accurate. The kitchen and the bedroom in the picture are not the kitchen and bedroom in the apartment we stayed in. Other than that Jenny was very good at communicating and made our stay great! The place was very cute and clean, and the location was perfect. The photos are NOT the same as the apartment we were directed to, buy they are very similar. There were a few teas and oatmeal packets, etc. available. The fridge smelled a little weird, and the hall of the apartment building smelled bad, but everything else was perfect! Great location, and easy check-in. Thanks Jenny! El departento de Jenny esta muy bien ubicado, cerca del subte lo q permite un acceso rápido a Times Square. Muy limpio. El barrio se siente muy seguro, nosotros llegabamos tarde y nos sentiamos comodos andando. Muchos lugares para comer por la zona. Detalle no menor, muy buena presion de agua en la ducha. Definitivamente volveriamos a quedarnos. Great location, clean NY apartment in a safe neighborhood. Close to subways and museums. Jenny was responsive to my questions. Very convenient location. Jenny replies quick to your messages and is really helpful. The photos are outdated. The photo of the bedroom is 100% not the bedroom that we stayed in. The apartment is tiny. There is inconsistency in communication. The water temperature in the shower fluctuated with the tiniest touch. The location is perfect though. The woman who met us with the keys to the apartment after finding the keys were not placed in the pick up location was not the woman in the photos posted on air Bnb. It felt like I was communicating with a false person. Great place, very clean and nice. Really good location. Jenny was very nice and responsive. Super clean. Nicely kept together and a great place with all the essential amenities, including a kitchen with stove. Perfect for two people wanting to explore NY. Jenny à etait au top on a pu accéder au airbnb plutot que prévu elle a été fort sympathique elle nous à même apporter en plus de sa des collations concernant l’appartement l’emplacement était top le lit confortable il faisait une bonne température dedans donc très agréable je recommande Great time!  Will stay here again next time when were in the city Nice location, subway/shops/restaurants within easy reach.\\nVery comfortable bed. Jenny quickly responded to my all questions! The unit is ideally placed in the city- close to the Q and walking distance to the Met and Central Park. The check in and check out process was easy- only required dropping the keys! Prima slaapplaats met een schone badkamer in een rustige straat in een hele leuke buurt Good location. Jeannie is very responsive. The flat is very close to the street and to the entrance so there\\'s noise. Great for a quick trip in and out of city. Quaint and cozy! The apartment was very clean when we arrived, and is a few minutes by foot to the nearest subway stop. The space was quiet for being located in the middle of a major city. We visited on some particularly warm days, and the space was quite warm at night,  but Jenny quickly responded by bringing us a fan, which made a huge difference. She was always responsive and check-in was easy. We would recommend staying with her in the future. We really appreciated Jenny coming right over when I lost the keys, and everything in the apartment worked just fine, the only issue we had is that there was only one coffee mug, so you might want to add another. Otherwise, perfect location, great experience of NYC right in the heart of midtown Manhattan, walking distance to the Met and Central Park and many many restaurants. A real NYC neighborhood experience! Amazing place Clean and updated, but it needs a lot to merit the amount charged versus value received.  Not great privacy (it\\'s street level, and loud if the windows are open) , no ventilation, and no added comfort as far as furnishings go. A double bed, a small low futon and a coffee table are the only furniture in the apartment.  The front window is covered by a bedspread thrown over a tension rod, and there are gaps in the coverage.   Not good for three adults; maybe two adults and a child on the futon.  I cannot give it a recommendation in good conscience at this time, based on our experience.\\nWith some attention to comfort (rugs, shelves near the bed for necessities, reading lamps, etc)  and the addition of air conditioning, this could be a decent place for two and a child. Very quiet apartment on the UES. The apartment is stylish and cozy and just what we needed for our stay. We spent every morning walking a couple blocks to the famous H&H Bagels then to Central Park for a nice breakfast picnic. Close to supermarkets that opens 24hours. Jenny was very easy to work with and responded to all my messages quickly. Check in and check out were super easy. We loved the apartment and the location in the Upper East Side. I highly recommend staying here! Die Lage der Wohnung ist Klasse. Subway ist zu Fuss gut erreichbar. Die Wohnung hatte leider keine Klimaanlage und es war fast unerträglich heiss und schwül (Aussentemperatur nachts z.T. bis zu 30 Grad). Die Küche war eher spärlich eingerichtet und es gab keinen Esstisch, sondern nur ein kleines Sofa mit  Couchtisch, an dem man nicht gut essen kann. Das Badezimmer war sauber. Der Kleiderschrank war z.T. mit persönlichen Gegenständen bestückt und bot wenig Platz zur Kleiderablage. Location can\\'t be beat for the value. Wonderful upper east side location just minutes walk to museums, 2 major subway stations, Central Park and the East River. The appartment modern and cozy. Having just lived a year in a tiny house it was luxurious. Check in and out was easy and communication was good.  I will definitely check availability next trip! great Great place, well located and comfortable. Jenny is a  very good, responsive and flexible host! Great apartment in a great spot. The apartment has a wonderful location in the Upper East Side and great value. It was easy to find the keys and was a simple but great place to stay for my work trip. Michelle was super responsive and communicative. Would recommend! Good location  The flat is a modern and renovated one-room apartment. Its location is pretty convenient, very close to the subway (line 4,5,6 and Q) with direct connection to Times Square. The area is safe and with many supermarkets and restaurants. The general cleaning and the essentials (towels and sheets) were the painful point, but the communication with the host was good and she was responsive and efficient. In detail, the flat is equipped with a double bed and a futon couch that can be used as second bed. The futon is quite short and it has a metal junction in the middle, therefore it is not very comfortable. The bed sheets provided were dirty and the amount of towels was not enough for the number of guests and days. There is a kitchen, dirty as well, and there is no table for eating, only a tiny coffee table is placed in front of the couch. The kitchen equipment is very limited (and dirty), but there is an useful microwave. The bathroom with bathtub was very dirty and without ventilation, we tried to open the window but we were not able (too old, too dirty and just opposite to the neighbors\\' window, therefore they could see us showering). On the other hand, as soon as we told to the host our problems and criticisms she replied immediately and she cleaned the bathroom and provided us clean towels. Host is great communicator, however, will will look elsewhere when we are in NYC next. We did not find the apartment clean or comfortable.  Muy buena ubicación, muy cómodo y sumamente recomendable. Appartement globalement bien situé mais pas à l\\'adresse indiquée en premier lieu! Clé à récupérer au pied d\\'un arbre à 400 mètres de là. Une tonne d\\'indications pour ne pas parler aux voisins et leur indiquer notre destination.... It\\'s small, but you have everything you need. All kitchen fittings are modern, a good firm bed and it\\'s quiet. Bayards Ale house nearby is a friendly local with good food. Great location, we easily found free street parking, went on bike rides in Central Park and across the Brooklyn bridge. Enjoyed the restaurants and nearby Starbucks. Great place, clean and close by everything. Very responsive to messages The host canceled this reservation 28 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Nice location! Bonjour,\\n\\nJe ne conseille pas cet appartement a part pour l’emplacement car proche du métro, de Times Square, Central Park. Pour le reste il est préférable pour le même prix voire moins cher de louer un hôtel. Tout d’abord l’adresse n’est pas celle indiquée sur le site. L’hôte ne vous préviens que 24h qu’il faut aller récupérer les clés à un endroit, puis aller à une autre adresse différente. Ensuite elle vous dit que si les voisins vous posent des questions il ne faut pas mentionner airbnb, que vous venez voir une amie appelé Roxanna idem si des inspecteurs passent. Tout ça n’est pas clair et donc pas rassurant surtout quand on vient d’un autre pays. Le frigo est vide, pareil pour les placards il n’y a rien pour prendre le petit déjeuner à part le café mais même pas un sachet de sucre ou de couverts. Le ménage n’est fait qu’en surface, toute la saleté est caché sous le lit, on comprend pourquoi il y a des cafards. Il fait hyper chaud il n’y a pas d’air la nuit on a l’impression de suffoquer les nuits sont longues. Le canapé est usé on s’enfonce dedans, le lit n’est fait que pour une personne. Il n’y a que petite table basse pour essayer de manger. L’appartement est face à une école donc beaucoup de bruits, le parquet grince de quoi réveiller tout l’immeuble et le sol n’est pas droit. On entend la chasse d’eau des voisins, on les entend rentrer et sortir de chez eux et on entend les personnes qui parlent dehors. Bref énormément de désagréments nous avons été très très déçu, l’appartement n’est pas à la hauteur de ce que l’offre met en avant et trop cher pour ce qu’il propose autant dire rien. Je suis dur mais pour une première fois que je réserve un airbnb je regrette ne pas avoir payé plus cher pour un hôtel. Our stay was good. It is a first floor apartment so being in the city and on the ground level you do hear quite a bit of noise, but not to the fault of the host. Perfect for one or two nights. Great host. The place is confortable and near the subway Bien en général pour le prix, l’équivalent d’une chambre d’hôtel côté grandeur, pas de table de cuisine si vous compter y déjeuner, ne laissez pas de nourriture traîner, j’ai aussi eu la visite de cafard...mais c’est aussi ça NY....J’y retournerais tout même Great location, great place. This place needs  a lot of attention to the basics, like painting the walls, installing the AC properly, redo the shower area, because it is so old, that it looks grimy even after being cleaned. The kitchen was in better shape, but missing the basics, like cups, bowls, silverware, cutting knife and kitchen towels. There was only one dirty pan to cook with, a very small pot and a dirty pot with a broken handle. Overall a very loveless place, no effort put into making it nice for the guest. I would never book this place again  and can\\'t recommend it. Small typical NY apartment in a great UES location. Perfect for one or two people who don’t plan on spending a lot of time in the apartment. la première adresse donnée n\\'est pas la bonne. \\nil ne faut pas mentionner qu\\'on vient par air bnb \\ncela dit le logement est bien situé. . Very nice location! Easy access and clean! I would stay here again! Thank you! Great spot. Good location and a good size for a couple who want to be out all the time. Unfortunately we didn’t feel the flat was very clean and will not be booking this apartment again. Michelle was very easy to communicate with and did kindly come and change the sheets on our request. Nice place to stay if your visiting NYC for a long weekend Had a great stay at Suzy\\'s hostel-like apartment. Quiet and in a really convenient and interesting part of the city. Located close to great restaurants and corner shops, I\\'d definitely recommend it to travellers on a budget. I should note our room was very echoey and didn\\'t have any windows, but the aircon was great and we slept soundly.  Great room!! The beds were comfy, perfect for my tourmates and I. The space was big, it was like a hostel style situation. Very nice place! Has a hostel vibe. Clean and spacious. It\\'s a big apartment with a lot of rooms, so you will share with other from airbnb. For the price, it was what we expected :) Great that we got towels and linen!  This place is really good for people who are on a budget but still wish to have a high quality stay. The rooms are clean, comfortable and not dim at all! (I hate rooms that are too dim) There are no windows in the room, in case someone concerns about that. The bathrooms and kitchen are good too. The location of this place is not near to the tourist spots, but that\\'s why the place isn\\'t noisy. For people who don\\'t drive, there are two metro stations with 5-15min walk from the place, which is quite convenient. Overall, a nice place with a good price. Y\\'know those scary stories you\\'ve heard/experienced (because i have before this) with bad Airbnb hosts that don\\'t communicate well & suck all around. NOT Suzy at all, she was an amazing host. also the restaurants around were delicious.  The neighborhood is really nice. 10min walk to subway station. Worth the price. Great place! Feels like staying in a hotel, not someone\\'s house.  We had a great time staying at Suzy\\'s place. She was very attentive to our needs as guests. Reaching out to her was never a problem and any questions we had...she had the answer to right away.   The place was cozy and clean. Close to the M train to get into Manhattan.\\nSuzy was a great host overall.\\n\\n\\n\\n Fantastic! Though it was a short stay, it was pretty sweet.\\nOne regret is that finding parking spot is tough and not closer to public parking garages. But other wise, it had been splendid. I m not satisfied with theses rooms The room is clean, close subway station, Suzy is a very nice person, thank you for your help.  A really nice place to stay. Location is as mentioned, not too far from Manhattan. Cleanliness is always maintained and you will find everything you need. Recommended.  Susy\\'s place was very clean , the shower had hot water, the room was clean and nice, the beds felt really well, also the room has a heater and air conditioner, definitely an excellent apartment to stay in NYC. Thanks Suzy :) we will be back soon If you\\'re looking for a place to sleep, then this place is perfect. Relatively well priced, and close to the train.  The outside of the place is a bit sketchy, as well as when you enter. But once you pass the kitchen the place is updated and modern. The rooms are beautiful and well kept . Very spacious with high ceilings. Only thing Is, Suzy was downstairs cleaning with 2 other girls, I waved hello, and she gave me the fakest smile along with an eye roll. Other than that the place was great and I enjoyed my stay! Good for a stay for 1 day Clean room. Kitchen space with table for work. Just that you share the space with many other rooms. It was great to stay in this house. It\\'s not to far from CBD and it\\'s easy to find if you follow host\\'s message. there are many grocery shops near house. Sharing Kitchen and bathroom are also clean.  Chambre qui nous a pleinement satisfaite, nous étions 4.  Great budget place to stay if you need somewhere to sleep and/or store stuff while you do things. Super clean! Exactly like the photos! A good amount of privacy. Very cozy! The room looked exactly as pictured and we found it to be really simple checking in and out. The bathrooms are shared among multiple units so plan to wake up early or you\\'ll end up waiting around for at least a little while. Overall though, it was a great value and I would stay again. This was awesome! When first arriving the neighborhood sketched me out a bit but right outside the apartment it\\'s totally fine. Suzy is very kind and helpful with all questions you may have. The room was very clean and beds were amazing. It was super helpful having two bathrooms with three showers total. One downfall with staying Saturday Sunday was the M line was down and we weren\\'t notified ahead of time. (We figured it out with ease) Great place to stay and will stay again!  Me and my friends had a nice stay at Suzy\\'s place. The rooms were clean, the appartment was close to a subway station and the neighborhood was nice. Only disadvantage is that the walls are kinda thin  and we slept next to a family with a baby but other than that we had a very nice stay A very convenient area. Had to stay the night last minute. Everything I need for family was a 10 min walk away. host totally not responsive. very late replies. misleading information in the messages. delayed answers from the host. didn\\'t respond after dozens of message sent. horrible experience. very unfriendly to adjustments. extremely inflexible to the requests.  Suzy\\'s place was really great. The beds were comfortable and the place was generally very clean and tidy. The neighborhood seems sketchy at first but is actually quite a cool place. Initially, we had trouble trying to get the AC to work because the water hadn\\'t been drained. But we eventually managed to work it out and it was working well for the duration of our stay. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who\\'s on a budget.  The room is tiny and claustrophobic in a hallwayway of many other rooms. Wouldn\\'t feel safe leaving my things here. would reccomend somewhere else at this price.  Ce logement ressemble plus à une auberge de jeunesse qu\\'à un logement Airbnb mais efficace pour le prix.  i highly recommend staying in Suzy apartment, really nice bon rapport qualité prix. Great communication, great price. Great for the price. 价格是挺便宜,但是晚上噪音太大,完全不隔音,床上用品太脏,睡着身上会痒 The place was really nice, it was close to 2 subway stations and 15 min to Manhattan. Safe, clean and close to centre of city. We spend nice 3 days there. This place great, it has all the essentials and is a short walk from the subway. The beds are very comfortable and the communal areas were kept clean. We only stayed for the night but it was a great stop off on our travels, would recommend. Great place, recommended if you\\'re ok sharing bathrooms and others living on the same floor as you. There were no windows in our room, A/C was too loud, but everything for really good price  \\nSuzy is very nice and she answer very fast. There is a one bathroom for around 9 rooms each available for 4 guests. This makes waiting line for bathroom around 30 minutes.\\nThe bathroom is too dirty. The toilet flush doesn\\'t work properly. The trash bin is full.\\nThere is a lot of noise. Since it\\'s a shared area for a lot of guests this makes the place noisy and impossible to sleep at.\\nNone of us could sleep for whole night also the floor was damage and by walking on it, it makes an awful noise specially infront of room #6. Make it even harder to sleep.\\nAlso there were many bugs on the floor in the room.\\nTerrible exprience although this isn\\'t our first exprience with airbnb. 1. No windows\\n2. Super noisy AC\\n3. Crappy floor that makes so much noise over the night that you can\\'t sleep\\n4. Around 10 rooms, it\\'s more like backpacking bed. \\n5. 1 functional toilet on these 10 rooms. \\n\\nBottom line: If I could go back in past, I wouldn\\'t stay in this accommodation. I don\\'t know how happened that this place earned 4 stars. Luckily, I stayed only 1 night and moved to another place. If I had to stay longer, I would be really angry. The floor is really loud. You can hear people walking on the hall as if they are in your room. You can also hear anybody who is on the hallway as the walls are thin. I don\\'t know why but there were ants everywhere which is a bit disturbing. There are only 2 bathrooms for like 6 rooms each of them with 4 people so you have to wait somethimes. It is 12-13 minutes away fron the subway. It is a cheap place and you get cheap conditiones. I would recomend paying 10-20 bucks a night more and have a better place. This flat offers somewhere to rest your head and basic amenities. Perfect for those who are out exploring New York all day. With a 10 minute walk to the subway, it\\'s really easy to get into Manhattan on the L line. The kitchen offers all you need to prepare and cook food. With 8/9 bedrooms and only 2 bathrooms, there may be the odd queue for the bathroom and as expected, it gets dirty quite quickly. With the amount of bedrooms, this should be advertised as a hostel rather than airbnb.  I would recommend checking that you haven\\'t got a room without a window (!) which we did - this obviously made it very stuffy. We had air con in our room but we found this to be very loud making it difficult to sleep. Suzy was a nice host, quick to respond and happy for us to leave our bags before check-in and after check-out which was really handy. The code on the door made it easy to get in and out as needed. This is perfect.Clean bedrooms, (Website hidden by Airbnb) is cheap and easy to find with (Hidden by Airbnb) maps.A good place for students and people who love to travel and also want to save some money. Clean, easy to go in downtown Manhattan and very good information from Suzy. However, the appartment is shared with other people  ( private bedroom but shared bathroom ), the bedroom have no window and a disturbing AC. Muy bien alojamiento cerca el metro para moverse a cualquier lado sin ningún problema muy limpio Very clean place and close to subway This space was perfect! Clean. Quiet. Lots of kitchen dishes to use and space in the fridge if needed. We never had a problem waiting for the bathrooms. We were always up early and sightseeing for the day! Was a perfect spot for us! And Suzy and her sister were great hosts! Would definetly go back again! Get place, easy, comfortable, no problems. Great value Definitely get what you pay for here .. Great for just sleeping! However, in room 6 there was a constant thudding happening throughout the night. Owner was informed and checked it out, but I don\\'t believe it was happening during the day. The sound continued through the second night. I’m frm SD Cali and visiting NYC, she makes u feel welcome after staying at her place we decided to look for another Airbnb a little more close for we’re we gonna go check out more places and it was horrible the smell, etc we decided to stay a little longer and contact Suzy for another stay as u read we definitely love her place thanks for ur hospitality Easy to check-in and our room was warm. Very good wifi connection. Suzy is a nice host. Thank you for your quick response. This place was just as pictured. Great stay. Others staying in different rooms might stay up a little later than you. Just keep this in mind if you’re a light sleeper. For me it was perfectly fine. Substations are within walking distance which is great. Didn’t take to long to get into NYC. For parking... one side of the streets get cleaned Monday and Friday and the other side gets cleaned Tuesday and Thursday or something like that. If you get there around 11-11:30 and wait till the cleaning truck passes by you’ll have somewhere to park no problem. Just look at the little signs by the road that announce the cleaning schedule. Parking fills up fast. \\nWould definitely stay here on future trips!!! Good It\\'s always a pleasure to stay at Suzy\\'s. She\\'s an excellent host! Very communicative, and accommodating. By far my favorite place to stay, and we will definitely be back again soon. I would recommend this place to because of the host, price, and cleanliness. Great place to stay at just for the night. My friends and I had no problems checking in because Suzy gave very clear instructions which I appreciated. The front of the house is somewhat sketchy but the inside is renovated and very well kept.  Great location and price for a trip to NYC. Suzy was responsive and very helpful. Highly recommend Suzy\\'s place! It was very clean, check-in was easy, and an excellent deal. . Good place to stay when visiting. No visitors allowed though Our stay with Suzy was amazing! Highly recommended. Amazing!\\n\\nAlthough we had a fair walk to Suzy\\'s place, it was very much worth it. The room was spacious and comfortable and very clean.\\n\\nI would definitely stay again. Please keep the toilet and sink clean. Also have extra blankets Suzy was a great host. She responded to my messages quickly. When I had a concern she helped me out. There was a few things I did not like which was an odor coming from one of rented rooms before my room. The room floor was dusty and I had to sweep it. Another thing was the heat the first night I arrived it was so cold. And the water was off due to pipe fixing without being alerted before booking. Other than that I liked the relaxing stay. Everyone was quiet at a certain time at time. I had a great sleep there. No one bothers you there. Super convenient and cheap! Don’t stay there! Love this place ❤️ A very positive experience, the house is clean and well equipped. The location of the apartment is good as it is close to two subway lines. In addition it is worth mentioning the proximity of the host, which at all times is willing to solve problems or doubts that may arise during the stay. 10/10 recommend and would definitely stay again. The place is clean, but the bedroom is noisy caused by AC unit. Clean, quiet, and affordable! Something that is sometimes hard to find in NYC. Location was great and room size was perfect for four people! good place to crash in after sight seeing\\n Good enough to stay overnight but for longer stay you are usually in a queue for the washroom and kitchen The passage is also very narrow between rooms excelente departamento, mejor de lo que se ve en las fotos great place if you’re just looking to sleep in it. Clean and affordable!, just beware with the other people staying around you, you could be woken up at anytime like we were at 3:30am with people walking around/children running in the halls and making food.  This place is nice for a cheap place to stay but is sooo far from the L. It also feels as cheap as it costs. The stay wasn’t bad at all but I def wouldn’t go back. Good luck to all others xx perfect to stay a night or two, very clean and basic with everything you need to feel recharged Expect to follow guidelines especially when it comes to Check out. It’s fast and doubt any extra time will be giving. Very basic room. Exactly what we needed. If you need entertainment bring laptop or iPad. House is very clean, beds are really comfortable. It’s very flexible check in.  Very good option when you are looking for just a bed in the neighbourhood of manhattan. everything is good Great for last minute reservations.  Affordable prices with a good, comfortable stay. It was very last minute so I highly appreciate the host for having a place for my family and I to stay on such short notice. Highly recommended. unfortunately these accommodations were not close to what we had expected. we did not want luxury accommodations, but it felt more like a hostel than a typical Airbnb room Everything was as described. Perfect for few nights. A good place to stay for a couple nights. Nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. Decent flat for folks who need a clean place to spend the night. Super easy check in, ideal if your out and about in the city! Safe neighborhood and quick walk to amenities and the subway It\\'s ok to stay here The location was close to metros. We felt nice neighbours. It was clean bed room. It was a bit noisy in hallway. It is low cost to visit New york. Great location, nice apartment. Overall good place for the price and quick stay Logement très bruyant, les murs n isolent pas dutout du bruit. Il y a constamment du mouvement la nuit jusqu\\'au petit matin, en tout cas durant notre sejour. La propreté est limite. Dans nos chambres, lits doubles x2, le chauffage/clim à fait énormément de bruit toute la nuit. Malgré tout le logement est bien située dans brooklyn avec accès au métro à a peine 5 min. You definitely get what you pay for here. This is not necessarily a bad thing and it worked out fine for us since the only time we spent there was to sleep. Check in was super easy and the subway is about a 10 minute walk away, about 45 mins to get most places in Manhattan. Some cons: the walls are super thin so you can hear everything going on, the air conditioning unit makes a continuous popping sound all day, and there can be a wait for the bathrooms. Excellent for what we were looking for. Just a place to stay for sleeping. Suzys space is safe and cozy, the temperature was just right and it was quiet. The directions to the place were perfect and it was easy to get into. Would definitely recommend! Thanks for having me good place I would deff stay again .... only thing could use a TV or speaker but things work out well Was clean walls just a little thin Good place to rest tho  Toni\\'s apartment was exactly what my family of 4 needed. While not large, the sseperate bedrooms and living area allowed us privacy and space. Totally beats paying twice the price for a hotel (Website hidden by Airbnb) apartment was in a great location. I\\'d definitely stay here again. Decent stay for a decent price. Super location friendly Great spot! It\\'s been a wonderful trip and the apartment is very clear and cozy.\\nAnd it\\'s near Time Square! I will recommend the apt to my friends. Great location, but very shabby and three crooked, steep, long flights of stairs to get to the apt. No elevator. Still can\\'t see the stairs mentioned in the description unless this was changed in the past three days.  One bath and hand towel each for four nights. Disappointed. The host is responsive and helpful. The apartment is in a great location and very quiet as the 2 windows face the back of the building. The walls don\\'t go all the way up to the ceiling (there is latticework at the top) so light and sound travel throughout this very small apartment. The place needs a more thorough cleaning and some renovation. What you see is what you get. Tiny place. Relatively clean. Incredibly close to restaurants and sights. Very easy to get to. We didn\\'t spend much time in the place, so it was perfect for what we needed. Ma famille et moi avons séjourné dans cet appartement super bien situé et bien propre. Seuls problèmes, il est un peu petit pour 5 personnes et de longs et étroits escaliers pour y monter. Mais nous avons bien apprécié de façon générale A great place to stay in NYC ! Thank you Toni ! Great location for its price. 5 minute walk to Koreatown, 10-15 walk to Times Square, about a 15 min drive to Chinatown, plenty of parking garages very close to the apartment. Has everything you\\'d get in a hotel plus a kitchen. There is a microwave sitting in the fridge but the cord doesn\\'t reach the outlet so you have to move it everytime you want to use lol. Location was a bit difficult to find for us there are no clear indications of where to enter. Be careful of the stairs it is very steep with some loose boards and spirals so choose your luggage carefully. Key is already at the location and there is no need to meet the owner elsewhere. Convenient. Overall I enjoyed the stay. A great find in NYC! Check-in/check-out very easy. Great area, felt safe late at night and could walk to many attractions in NYC. Plenty of bars and restaurants around. The beds were comfortable and the place was clean and cute. There is a windy stair case up to the room, but it\\'s worth the climb. I would recommend. Excellent location and communication. Key was not left so later check in than anticipated but Toni came within 30 minutes to get us into apartment. Convenient for commuting from penn station. location is great. Toni\\'s place has a very great location. It is a great experience to enjoy his department in New York. Hope we can meet next time. It has 2 TVs, the rooms have AC, there are lots of stairs to the 4th floor but its not bad. Apartamento muy bien situado , muy cerca del empire state  , zona animada pero tranquila . Hemos estado 4 personas perfectamente . Edificio antiguo , apartamento pequeño pero perfecto para 4 . Toni nos ha contestado muy rápido a cualquiera de nuestras dudas . 位置超级棒!就在帝国大厦的隔壁街区,走到时代广场也不到10分钟,这个地段这个价格真的不错,行李多的小伙伴要注意,没有电梯,只有很窄的楼梯,最多可以住四个人,所以拼房很划算｡房间很干净,但是确实小,不过对于住宿足够了｡Great location and incredible near to everything such as the Empire ,Times square and Macy\\'s,the bed is soft and clean, definitely a cost-efficient deal!And there is a luggage storage just downstair of the apartment.I would recommend it with 5 stars! I stayed here for a work trip and was pleased with it. Thanks to previous reviews, I knew about the narrow stairs so packed accordingly. It\\'s a typical NYC apartment and was fine for what I needed. There is not a stove, just a hot plate...and while it may have said that in the listing, i didn\\'t realize that until I got there. But since there are bodegas on every corner, who needs to cook? The location is perfect - easy walk from Penn Station and many subways. Can\\'t beat the location! Toni was very communicative as well. If you\\'re looking for affordable semi hostel vibe in a good location Toni place can fit you just fine. \\nThe pictures are accurate, what you see is what you get. \\nFor me, I\\'m a bit spoiled and I need more from my Airbnb. More home feeling away from home and that is not the case with Toni place. \\nThere is no sun light in the apartment or the ability to open the windows. \\nIt\\'s on the 4 floor with tiny staircase. \\nAnd the wall between the 2 bedrooms does not go all the way to the ceiling. \\nBut, \\nToni response fast to almost every question, he let me do an early check in and when the wifi didn\\'t work he fixed the problem quickly. \\nThe water pressure was fine and the apartment was relatively clean. \\nI won\\'t stay there again as I\\'m looking for more of a homey Airbnb. \\nBut if you are looking for good value and you are not spoiled like me Toni place can fit you good. Location location location. Toni’s place was in the middle of everything we wanted to do The wifi is an old repeater and doesn\\'t function. Everything else is as described. Toni\\'s place is in a nice and safe location, about 10-15 minute walk from Penn Station. It is clean, cozy, and up 4 flights of (narrow/winding) stairs. The bathroom was much larger than expected. There was easily enough room in the living area for the three of us and we had the basics that we needed. It was great for a short weekend in the city. On the day of our check-in, I had to initiate communication about the keys, but Toni responded with the information and even included a picture with the instructions. Thank you! Good location. Good quality/price ratio. 4th floor, no elevator El hospedaje está súper bien ubicado, entre la 5ta y 6ta avenida, a dos cuadras del subte, con locales de comida, farmacia y un recién inaugurado supermercado Target, pero el departamento no tiene cocina, solamente microondas, son 4 pisos por escaleras angostas, y no tiene ventilación natural, pero como se dice “location, location, location!!!” El resto muy bien, limpio, camas cómodas, y buen baño! This apartment is in a small building sandwiched between two large hotels. The old building is a little creaky but you really can’t beat it for location and price. It has a kitchenette with everything you could need including a great fridge. The shower is good. It is worth noting that the walls are just lattice at the top so you can hear everything in every room and light travels through the apartment as well. Great for a quick stay in midtown, easily accessible. Given it’s lively location the atmospheric sounds of New York can be heard for most of the night. Toni did a great job in communicating check in. Would have maybe liked to receive details sooner to better plan the trip. But otherwise, the space was perfect for a quick trip This was a really nice house it\\'s in the middle of the city which made it convenient to walk Toni was responsive and the location was awesome Amazing location in the heart of NYC!!! Tony is also really reactive! Tony\\'s apartment was in a great location. Perfect for our night in the city! Great location! Just around the corner from Macy’s, Bryant Park, and the Empire State Building. Also close to Penn Station and plenty of subway stations. Be ready to clubs a few flights of stairs- but this is expected in most NYC buildings. Tony was a great host. I had a couple questions regarding check-in and he was very quick to respond. Great apartment for a few days in the city! A1 place for the price Everything was as described.  Checking was quick and easy.  Location was excellent.  It’s actually near hotels that cost much more.  It’s a good value and convenient for anything you want to do.  Tony was very responsive as well. Thanks Tony for very good communication - stay was comfortable. Great location! Hello everyone. I would highly recommend Tony\\' s airbnb to anyone who comes across. It was an amazing location and only was a few blocks down from time square. It also was only a street away from the Empire State Building. The only thing I would want you to know is that the apartment is not intended for handicap/disabled people because it was very hard for my wife to climb up stairs. In order to get to the apartment you have to climb up 3 flights of stairs in order to get to the apartment. Other then that it was a great small place to stay and convenient. Convenient location and good communication with host. Convenient place to visit Manhattan.\\nQuiet and clean. Incredible Great Value! The location of this apartment is tremendous for a very affordable price. Super convenient to get to everywhere. Thats what i enjoyed appreciated the most. The indoors was just like the pictures and had enough beds for my friends and me. If you want a convenient location to spend time in the city, let Tony be your host. Cant go wrong. Tony\\'s place is exactly as advertised.  It is small but a good value for the location and essentially 4 sleeping options.  2 beds and one being a carriage bed that fit two separately plus a couch.   No living room. Kitchen and living room are the same.  Place is on a busy street but that\\'s NYC. 4 floors.  This place looks to be strictly a Airbnb.  \\n\\nWould book again for the price and location. Tony\\'s apartment is in a great location right around the corner from the Empire State Building. If you want somewhere reasonable to stay in the heart of Midtown Manhattan this is a good option.   Tony is a quick communicator for any needs. Easy to check into. This place is good if you\\'re in town touring around. You\\'ll have access to many subway lines. It\\'s simply outfitted but comes with a hairdryer, fridge and microwave. I was here for work so it wasn\\'t super ideal for that but there are many Starbucks around if you need a spot to work. But I see the value in staying here  if you\\'re planning on needing a place to crash and shower.  Place was in a central location and everything was just as listed in photos & posting, Thank you. Price is cheap for such a great location, host is available to help you when information is needed and directions are clear. Would love to stay there again for my next trip in New York. Toni’s place was perfect for what we had to to central location to every place we needed to go. We left a fur coat Toni got it and plans to mail it to us. Thanks Toni All went smoothly. Small place but excellent value given location. This is a small 2 bedroom in a fabulous location. The price is phenomenal and the apartment is very clean and well stocked with dishes and cooking supplies. The bathroom is quite large, but its diffucult to regulate the water temperature which can get scalding hot. The bathroom floor is also slanted (similar to the steps). Because the bathroom is a bit uneven the shower curtain falls in on you. Towels are small and you only get 4. STEPS Don\\'t be fooled, this apartment is not for the unfit. The stairs are steep, narrow and a bit slanted. Let\\'s say they have character. I would not have been able to carry a full size suitcase up. All said and done, the price is GREAT, the location AMAZING and the apartment CLEAN. It was perfect for our needs. Pack some trash bags, a roll of papertowels, and pack light. Also note the owner was completely inflexible on check in check out times and would not provide a 2nd set of keys. Told us we could make one at our own expense but that we would have to turn them in. Appears to be a business property with no personal touch or flexibility, but fit our needs. Tony\\'s is a great host and makes himself available for any questions and concerns.  His place is cozy, perfectly located for tourism of Manhattan, and near several subway stations.  I highly recommend Tony\\'s Airbnb apartment.  My teenage boys enjoyed the fact that it has two small rooms so they had a bit of privacy.  All electronic equipment and heater worked perfectly. In my opinion,  hard to beat this deal. It’s a great place to stay. Decent spot. Good location. Very simple spot. I rented this for my 19 year old son and his friend based on so many positive reviews.  They boys had a blast, everything worked out as Tony described, perfect location, very clean and they felt safe.  Tony was very responsive when I had questions.  We were having a blizzard here in Boston, and he came up with another apt if they had to extend their stay, which gave me great peace of mind. Tony\\'s place is at the perfect location in Manhattan. Everything is within walking distance - that saves a lot of time and money for transport. The price is truly excellent compared to Manhattan rates and hotels. It was very clean, the sheets, mattresses, towels and dishes are new and good. The wifi was slightly spotty initially (which was tolerable and we didn\\'t complain about), but it was fixed during our stay, and worked perfectly from then on.\\nThe stairs have been mentioned already. We didn\\'t mind them.\\nThe instructions we received regarding finding and entering the apartment were perfect.\\nThere is a gas water heater. We aren\\'t used to them, so we had a slightly hard time getting the temperature right when having a shower. Great location and host. I left an item and he offered to take the time to send it back to me! The apartment is exactly as it seems in the listing. I visited NYC with my two teenagers. They wanted their own rooms, so this made a better option than a hotel room. My spoiled children were disappointed at first because the building is a bit run down, but the place is clean. We arranged beds and mattresses so that each of us had our own room, and this made it comfortable. Minor drawbacks include: the water temperature was difficult to control (it was hot), somebody in the floors below smoked cigarettes so there was the smell of second hand smoke. Nice sized space. Easy check in.  Good for the cost.   Host could communicate better. But overall I would recommend and stay there again. This location is perfect for bachelors wanting to explore the city! We really appreciated the location as it made it accessible to many attractions, such as the empire state  building and time square. There were also many restaurants around the apartment so we also liked that :). Very clean and quiet, which is unusual for this busy, centrally-located area.  A short walk to the subway and lots of stores nearby.  Tony was very communicative and check-in was easy. Tony\\'s place was great for our stay! Location is very convenient and the apartment was clean and as described. It was very easy to communicate with Tony during our stay. Check-in and check-out were very easy. Thanks! Everything as expected from the description and the reviews. We needed a place to rest from touring around. This was a perfect place and in an ideal location. Tony was a very nice host and gave us simple directions on how to manage our stay. The space was nice and comfortable for two people, but the building itself is certainly very run down. We had everything we needed but if you have trouble walking stairs, this may not be the place for you. Close to everything in the heart of Manhattan Appartement très propre et bien situé. Très bon rapport qualité prix. We were looking for an affordable and convenient place to stay - this is exactly what Tony\\'s place was! Perfect price range and location for a weekend in NY exploring the surrondings. Logement très bien situé. Creepy entrance, staircase is ridiculous, old, steep, and winding. \\nTony is nice, but the place tiny and just average. Great use of space to create two bedrooms.  Comfy and so surprisingly quiet which I did not expect for staying midtown. Location is fantastic. Pros: Apartment is suitable for multiple  Great location and good communication !! Would stay again! his was my first time utilizing airbnb. The experience was superb. Tony was very communicative and an outstanding host. Every time I return to New York and need a place to stay, it will be this location if it is available. What a great experience! Thanks, Tony! unfortunately, this was my worst Airbnb experience. the couch was completely un-sittable. the floors were nice but the walls and doors were not clean, found dead bugs and the ceilings seemed unfinished/falling apart. the worst part was that I woke up with bug bites both mornings. sorry, Tony! I\\'m not one to complain but I didn\\'t feel comfortable having my daughter at your place.  Die Wohnung hat eine optimale Lage und für junge Reisende optimal zum Sightseeing. Das einzig schwere, ist es die Koffer in den 4. Stock zu schaffen. Great location. Within a few blocks from Penn Station and Empire State building. \\nEasy to walk anywhere in midtown. \\nBe prepared to carry your luggage 4 flights, but expected for NYC. Located in the heart of everything. great value, would easily stay at this location again. Was a perfect accommodation if you are looking for something steps away from Times Square. It was basic but was clean and comfortable. El acceso por las escaleras es un poco dificultoso y la habitación de matrimonio algo pequeña. Sin embargo, la localización es muy buena Great value for the cost. Not a ton of living space but a perfect location. A very good starting point to discover New York. Good value for money. Very good communication with Tony Nice place with lots of things to do nearby Le logement est très bien situé, les lits sont bons, mais l’immeune est limite, sur les photos, l’apparmement semble beaucoup plus grand.\\nLa salle de bain laisse à désirer . Had a good stay would do it again for sure Das Appartment ist für einen kurzen Aufenthalt in New York perfekt. Es verfügt über zwei Schlafzimmer mit jeweils einer Klimaanlage. Leider gibt es keinen Aufzug, sodass man schwere Koffer vier Etagen nach oben tragen muss. Die Lage ist perfekt. Das Empire State Building ist zwei Straßen entfernt und der Times Square ist ebenfalls in 10 Minuten fußläufig zu erreichen. U-Bahn ist nur 2 Minuten entfernt und der größere Bahnhof \"Penn Station\" ist ebenfalls nur 5 Minuten entfernt. Wir waren sehr zufrieden. Great place to crash in the middle of Manhattan. Clean, functional, and well located. Tony is a great host! 5 stars would recommend.  Cool place  This Airbnb is in a historic tenement building surrounded by modern hotels. The lodging was up a 4 floor walkup with a narrow leaning staircase. The building has definitely seen better days. It was very clean on arrival, but due to some mixup not enough linens were provided for all guests. After messaging the owner, additional towels and blankets were provided. Then we realized additional  sheets were not included in the new linens, we rooted around in the apartment and found an extra sheet for the final bed stashed in a bag in the single closet. The pictures for this place make it appear much larger than it is. So don\\'t expect much more than 250 sq feet divided into 4 rooms. It is very quiet in the building. Be careful with the hot water in the shower as it is somewhat unpredictable and can go from lukewarm to scalding without changing the dials. One note: we were told that a luggage storage business was located on the second floor and made plans around that, it was not available for whatever reason the day we checked out. We had to make shift at the last moment. We had already checked out (locked keys in apartment) at this point, and the offered later checkout by the owner couldn\\'t be used. Overall owner was very responsive to messages, and we enjoyed our stay in New York. 位置优越,价格有点优势,但真不要对其他有什么更好的期待,两天没有热水洗澡,爬楼梯真要命……建议多加点钱提前预订一下住附近的酒店吧 Exactly as listed: perfect location, great space, 4 flight of stairs, clean. Just what we needed for a place to stay at night! Centrally located and exactly the same as advertised. We stayed in the city for work and in the appartement just for sleeping - we could not have done more, there is no windows in the living room and it is very loud outside due to all the AC running - it is the same though for all NYC aprtmt in the area.  It is often said that property is all about \"location, location, location\".   If that\\'s true then this apartment ticks that box.  Midway between Times and Herald Squares; around the corner from the Empire State and Penn Station, its location is unquestionably in the heart of tourist New York.\\nDespite the large number of stairs and their \"quirky\" angle - the apartment is on the 3rd/4th floor - it\\'s still well located.\\nTony\\'s friendly and professional communications in advance, along with simple checkin and checkout procedures also add to the positives.\\n\\nHowever, it\\'s not always about the location, of course.  Re-reading some of the reviews whilst there (not a great sign), there were a lot of coded references to \"use as a base\"; \"a place to crash\" etc.  \\nWhilst the apartment may be \"cozy\",  it is certainly in need of significant renovation.  It\\'s air-conditioned, and ear plugs are provided to cope with the noisy units.\\nThe beds are \"functional\" although, along with the bathroom, they could do with some deep clean and renovation.\\nIn short, if you are looking for a short stay, perhaps on your own or with some mates who aren\\'t that fussy (as a \"place to just sleep\"), then this would do.   If you were looking for anything that offered a modicum of comfort or homeliness, then you would be better served booking elsewhere, as I would on my next visit. Great clean place in a great location, owner works in the building so you get fast response. Can\\'t wait to go back. This apartment is in a great location in Midtown, New York to use as a base for the exploration of the city and its major landmarks. There is a subway station quite close by for added convenience. \\n\\nAs other commenters have noted, access is via several storeys of side-leaning stairs which may cause difficulties for some guests. Overall our stay was great. Great location. The stairs are steep and narrow, not ideal for elderly people. Tony was a great host as far as your goodwill with us and the speed at responding to our requests. Some small problems we encounter in the apartment do not prevent us from recommending your rental to new guests, just intending to help improve their service, The two very favorable points were his treatment with us, always helpful, and the privileged location of the apartment. Thank you for everything and all the best for you! Marcelo, Ângela and Alda Great location. Unfortunately, the host was not accesible and willing to assist the guest during disinformation. Logement exigu accessible par un escalier très raide \\npièce principale sans fenêtre\\nBien placé et relativement calme pour Manhattan Tony\\'s apartment is in a fantastic location - perfect for a first time NYC explorer or a seasoned traveler. Thanks again for your hospitality, Tony! All the things you read about the condition of the apartment is right. The staircase is narrow, steep and sloped, but still manageable even with suitcases. The shower is working fine, but yes, one needs to get to know how to work it, so you will not scold yourself. Everything else you read is also true, but the pictures are telling it as well. It is not a 5 star hotel, but a nice little apartment with the things one needs for a short stay away from home. We did not expect more than we had seen in the pics and were not disappointed. Plenty of towels.\\n\\nThe apartment was very suitable for us – two friends – we each had our own room, a shared living room and bath and it worked just fine for us. Location is very good and within walking distance to the things, we wanted. \\n\\nWe could have done with an extra set of keys, as we tend to do separate things during our travels, but we managed.\\n\\nCommunication with Tony was very easy, responded quickly to questions and gave a very good and detailed description of the check-in procedure on the day of arrival. Storing our luggage on departure day worked very well as well.\\n\\nWe can recommend staying with Tony. Fuyez. Emplacement impeccable. Il n y a que ça de bien. Impossible de dormir nous étions 4 chacun une nuit dans cette chambre une horreur. J ai à peine dormi 2 h en prenant somnifère. Prendre une douche dans la baignoire vu l état c est un exploit. Aucun petits produits d accueil. Porte entrée un jour dans le bas de porte. Je suis habitué airbnb mais là juste une horreur If you are looking for a simple place to rest your head when visiting NY this place might be for you. The location is just awesome. The beds were clean and comfortable. It was really quiet too and we all slept well. The four flights of stairs are difficult to navigate especially going down. I only had an overnight bag. I would not want carry a large suitcase on these stairs. The bedrooms are small and the couch is old and worn. The bathroom is spacious but not for somebody with an aversion to mold. Sadly there was barely any toilette paper and the host couldn\\'t remedy that issue. The building is old and a bit scary. I could not find a fire escape. Overall if you don\\'t care for the ambiance of place and your are young and fit enough to navigate the stairs this place is a good value because of its location. It also provides everything to make your own breakfast and heat up some food which might be helpful for somebody on a budget. Very mixed feelings. \\n\\nThe localisation of the appartment was perfect, only some meters away from the empire state building and the subway station. Very good. \\n\\nBut some negative very important points.\\n\\nNot an easy access, stairs are very narrow and you have 4 floors to climb. The steps are high. I was with my grandmother and she had to stop herself in the middle to rest. Keep that in mind if you’re old or injured. You may reconsider because of the stairs. \\n\\nNot possible to let the luggage on the week end in the building . You have to find a luggage store (we paid 10$ by luggage on a luggage store near the appartment.)\\nYou can let them during the week if you pay.  Not very usefull when you leave on weekend. \\n\\nThe appartment is old and very much needs to be refreshed : bathroom is dirty, some walls too. \\n\\nA lot of problems with heating and hot water. We had to ask to the super (communication with our phone), who was not in the city. After a 8 hour flight, impossible to have hot water and barely feeling the heating. The super could only be in town the next day. What a cold first night.\\n\\nCommunication sometimes difficult with Tony who disagreed with my asking for a luggage keeper. \\n\\nHowever, Tony always replied quickly to my messages. Nice place to crash for a few nights in the heart of NY We loved it it was perfect The location is pretty good. Tony provided clear check-in instruction, the room is nice and clean. It might be a little bit noisy in early morning, since the room window is facing the street. Location is 10/10, apartment quality 5/10 max. But also it’s New York and you want a bed and not a 5* suite. Read through older reviews, everything said is accurate. Tony responded very quickly and friendly! Tony’s place is in a great location. You will be near tons of restaurants, transportation, and site seeing. Tony’s place has plenty of space and 2 separate bedrooms. We enjoyed our time there it met all of our needs! Great location in midtown. Very comfortable beds. Value worth the money. Very fast response from Tony and very detailed which was helpful when checking into the apartment. The apartment is conveniently located to many restaurants, bars, shops and two train stations.  You do have to walk up three flights to the apartment, but we did it multiple times with no issue.  Tony provided very detailed instructions as to how to enter the apartment so it was quite easy. Everything is as good as the description,  expect the stairs are a little steep and the shower didn\\'t work. Nice location. narrow and steep staird up to 4th floor. Great place very close to subway and places for food. Highly recommended! Morgan is great to work with and everything was as we expected. Excellent location in a bustling neighborhood and right next to the JMZ line. It was nice My friends was absolutely happy with that apartment :) Great location, comfortable beds, clean, spacious. It could sometimes be a little loud so you may want to bring ear plugs just in case. My friend and I had a wonderful time. Very clean place.  Great location in a quiet neighborhood.  We enjoyed our stay! We felt safe in the neighborhood, even late at night. The place is well situated and clean. However, it is lacking in basic kitchen essentials (kettle, microwave, toaster) and the wifi is poor. Williamsburg is a nice and vibrant neighbourhood. This is a nice, cozy spot in Brooklyn that is very close to the Subway. The space was perfect for a 1 night stay. No doors between rooms, but great location right next to the JMZ lines. We had a good stay and would recommend this apartment. The school busses start honking at 6 am so its a bit noisy, so bring earplugs. The bathroom and kitchen could have been a bit cleaner, and bring an extra towel because the host only provides 1 for each guest, we stayed a week and 1 towel was not that hygienic in our opinion. Great location and Morgan was super easy to book with. The building itself is a little dirty, but nothing out of the usual for older NYC buildings. Morgan\\'s place was super clean and had plenty of space.  Would definitely stay again! We had a nice stay, the apartment was we were expecting. Thanks! The location is great. The apartment is very basic, and is a bit noisy. Don\\'t expect anything more than bare bones accommodations--the mattresses aren\\'t very comfortable, and there\\'s no coffee or any other little touches you might be used to seeing in Airbnbs. It\\'s a good crash pad, though--parking is really easy and two train lines are around the corner. A fine little place in a great location. We had trouble connecting to the Wi-Fi but since we didn\\'t spend much time awake there, it was not a big deal. Neighborhood felt very safe, lots of great things to do nearby. Quiet, safe area in Brooklyn and close to local trains. Got to Manhattan within 20 minutes and the G is a short walk which takes you right to Downtown Brooklyn. Great place and comfy beds! The location of this apartment is extremely convenient. The beds are really comfortable. It was very clean. We were uncomfortable being an unlocked building, although the neighborhood is very safe. Morgan’s place is wonderful! Just what we needed for a nights stay in New York. It is an open area plan apt, but she made sure to add curtains that gave us a nice touch of privacy. The parking was a little difficult to find, but nothing that would deter us from staying here again. Subway into the city is super close and ferry is a close walk as well. We loved it- Thank you! Morgan’s space is even nicer than advertised. Super clean apt, great grocery stores and restaurants within 4 min of walking. I’m in NYC 20% of my life and I always use Air b&b. And I highly recommend this space for business travel in particular. Spacious space. Convenient. Across from metro. Good basic space We loved Morgan\\'s place! It was the perfect location - just steps away from the M line with restaurants, bars and a grocery store just nearby. The apartment was quiet, spacious and the beds were super comfortable. We had a great stay and would definitely stay there again in the future! Great location and very easy/flexible check in. The apartment itself is neat and spacious, however building itself was messy (not a huge deal). The door to the building does not lock, which we felt a bit uneasy about at first but did feel very safe in the area. Communication with host was great until the time of our stay. Had some trouble with the radiator and connecting to WiFi, which was never resolved. Not the end of the world, but a bit disappointing as we opted for a night in (I am pregnant and it was a snowy) so our entertainment options were limited. Overall a sufficient place to stay for a night or two with basic amenities, but would probably not stay here again. The flat is more like à small loft, very confortable clean and well équiped. The location in Williamsburg is Great. 1mn from Hewes subway station that bring you in Manhattan very quickly. The heat insulation and wifi connection should be improved for a perfect stay in Brooklyn.Neighbour very quiet but outside train a bit noisy.bring your ears plugs.Very Nice trendy casual café and restaurant 2mn walking distance:vélo bar and  flatsBKcafe. This apartment is in a wonderful location - VERY close to the subway and easy to navigate to, with a short commute into Manhattan. The bedrooms are cute with simple, modern decor and are both clean and comfortable. The host is also very easy to get in touch with and work with. We were surprised by a couple of things that hadn\\'t been mentioned in previous reviews - one of the windows in the bedroom (off of the fire escape) does not lock and was wide open when we arrived which made us feel a bit uneasy, there are two large windows inside of the shower which are not covered, and the occupants of the building itself were pretty loud (lots of dog barking). That being said, the street and neighborhood are SUPER quiet, making it a nice hideaway in the midst of a trip to busy NYC. It was a good place to stay for us on a quick overnight trip in the city and a good price for its proximity to the subway and Manhattan. Great place! Morgan’s place is in a great location to catch the subway and within walking distance to food. The building itself was a bit untidy, but her apartment was very clean and spacious. Neighbors were nice and we felt very safe. Would definitely stay there again! Place was clean and great location Clean place, close to trains.  Good deal for the price.  Good stay All and all it was great. I recommend it. Great location and walkable! Quiet, clean, and easy. Morgan was super responsive and I\\'d easily stay here again. Morgan\\'s place is spacious and clean. Beds are comfy. Neighborhood was quiet and safe. Everything was exactly as represented on Airbnb, if not even nicer than it seemed. Super convenient to get around and I was even able to find street parking without a struggle. Truly perfect! Thanks! This place was a great find! Super close to public transportation and BK nightlife. We had a great evening and enjoyed the spring breeze as we walked back to the apartment. The beds were super comfy and the bathroom very clean. Couldn\\'t ask for much more. Exactly what I needed for a quick night stay. And the main bedroom is nice and bright! Great location, nice clean space and great value. Would recommend to anyone needing a place to stay in NYC. The location was great as it was close to the subway situation and convenience stores. You can hear the train running at night but it wasn’t too hard to sleep Morgan’s place was great. Clean, tidy and lovely. I would def recommend it. We had a great stay over there! Great communication, accurate description, safe/walkable neighborhood, close to subway. Apartment is clean and bright. The house was very clean. Towels, sheets, pillows, and blankets were provided. There was some noise from the metro and neighbors beside and above, but it wasn’t too bad. Great walking distance from the metro and a food market store. Would definitely recommend staying here. Morgan\\'s place was conveniently located and comfortable. It was the perfect home base for our stay in the area! We wouldn\\'t hesitate to stay there again! We had a great stay at Morgan\\'s place! It\\'s very well connected to the subway and great to get around. It also has everything you need for a family stay! Brilliant place, fantastic safe and convenient location. Thank you! Prima plek voor een vakantie. In Joodse wijk. Stukje lopen en je zit in hip Williamsburg om te eten. Vlakbij metro en supermarkt. the apartment has some potential and it’s great that it is so close to subway. however, it wasn’t very clean and i wouldn’t stay there again. Great stay in Morgan flat ! Very close to the subway station that links with manhattan. Big flat with extra room and space to chill, neighbors very helpful and Morgan has very easy to contact for any issue or question. Will definitely recommend it ! Very cool apartment. Great neighborhood and very close to subway. Morgan’s place was the perfect hideaway for our NYC trip. Located right next to the J and M train, it was super easy to navigate into Manhattan. The apartment has beautiful floors, the bedroom is super cute. Both beds were super comfortable and the sheets were super soft. Morgan was always quick to respond. We had such an amazing time in her flat and can highly recommend a stay. The front entry door is broken and not locked the stairwell is dirty and smelt of urine.. we actually canceled due to these reasons .. plus the fact that Morgan told us to tell the neighbors we were house sitting. The neighbors said no Morgan lives there. .  Nor was her name listed on the mailboxes  Unfortunately we had a very bad stay for us, besides that the building was so dirty it was very unpleasant (inside and out) plus the noise of the neighbor upstairs (all steps are heard), the barking of the dog next door and The bad connection to the internet makes everything worse. On the 4th day we found a mouse in the apartment above the refrigerator eating our food, we had to stay until the next day where after several disputes they gave us part of the nights already paid. I feel that it has been such a horrible experience for us. But the reality that happened to us. Absolutely lovely and cozy place. Great location. Definitely will stay here again next time. Close to subway in to Manhattan but quite a walk to the more hip Williamsburg area with cool restaurants and shops (Bedford ave). Quite a run down area and building, felt safe in the Jewish quarter, however. Clean bathroom but could do with a proper washing of the floors. Noisy AC in the bed room, even when un-plugged it kept on \"clicking\" annoyingly for a light sleeper. Great location and a great value on a good apartment. Was happy to be right near the train and in Williamsburg. The place was clean, bright, and air conditioned. The apartment gave us all that we needed (two bedrooms, some kitchen space, and quiet enough for kids to nap midday).\\n\\nOne note, the bedrooms are separated by curtains rather than doors, so if you need more room-to-room privacy or quiet (say, for a very small child), it may be good to take this into account. We had no problem with it, but it was a bit of a surprise. On the plus side, the \"middle\" bedroom gets pitch black during the daytime which is great for toddler napping. Morgan\\'s place does exactly what it says on the tin.  Great place in a safe neighbourhood right next to the station for trains into Manhattan.  Would definitely stay again! Great space - pretty large for what we needed (2 people). Cool spot overall morgan’s place is amazing! great location and in a super safe neighborhood. couldn’t be happier- thanks, morgan! Would not recommend : ants in the bathroom, coarkroaches in the kitchen, building entrance was extremely dirty. \\nThe door handle to the appartment was even broken. Overall very disappointing stay.  Good location, really easy to get into Manhattan and good for exploring Williamsburg. The apartment building is really dirty but apartment itself was clean and tidy.  This location seemed safe, was very close to the subway and corner stores, and the lock box entry was simple enough, so it served it’s purpose for a reasonably-priced overnight crash pad. I messaged Morgan through the Airbnb app to ask if we could check in a little early, but received no response. It wasn’t a huge issue so I didn’t feel the need to follow up with a phone call. \\n\\nJust beware this is very bare bones and we almost turned around and left just as soon as we arrived; I wish I could post the pictures that I took. The building is run down, there is no door handle on the front door to the apartment so closing the door and locking the deadbolt is a pain, the apartment itself did not seem like there was much effort put into its’ appearance (smudges all over the walls and floor, broken poster frame, a dirty mop/ladder/cleaning supplies left out in the corner, no paper towels, etc.) and it smelled nauseatingly strongly of Febreeze.\\n\\nThe window in the main bedroom does not close or lock due to the AC unit; there is a gap between the window and the AC unit which lets in all of the noise from the street and is a safety issue as there is a fire escape right next to it. Again, the neighborhood seemed safe enough but I was uncomfortable with an open window.\\n\\nThe AC unit is loud and pops on and off, so between that and the cracked window to let in all of the street noise (there was construction going on in the street directly out front) we got zero sleep. The bed was comfortable, fresh towels and extra sheets were provided, and the main bedroom got a lot of natural light, so there are pros.\\n\\nThe shower (which has very light water pressure) has windows in it and only one is frosted, so I was uneasy taking a shower as people can see in if they are on that side of the building.\\n\\nOverall, if none of these things are an issue to you then it’s a decent value to stay in a convenient location close to the city. Personally, this was not an enjoyable stay and I will be staying elsewhere during my next NYC visit.  Slept like a baby Nice place and great location. Would stay there again.  A cozy and comfortable apartment with all the basics for a home away from home - including air con and a great shower! A bit of a walk from the nice end of Williamsburg but we found a great coffee shop called Northerly Coffee on Havemyer St.  The good: location. Really easy to get to Manhattan and the rest of Williamsburg. \\n\\nThe bad: We had an issue with the lockbox code, and the host didn’t reply until hours later. We ended up wasting $ making international calls to Airbnb to sort this out. \\n\\nThe AC unit in the bedroom works fine, but it’s very loud. I could barely ignore it with good quality earplugs, and did not sleep well. \\n\\nThe neighborhood seemed safe, but the building is run down and dirty. The door to the apartment is missing a handle, so there’s not much to grab on to when you try to close it.  Cons: old building and a bit dirty. The apartment itself was clean, but it had some issues: a lot of dust in the backside of lamps and furniture, for instance. During our 1 week stay we only saw 1 bug in the bathroom. The AC on the upstairs flat was leaking and the drops on our AC were very noisy. We had to put one shirt on our AC in order to reduce the metallic sounds of the water dropping. \\nPros: considering NY prices, the quality-price relationship was very good. Also the location, very close to a subway station and on a safe neighborhood The apartment complex was dimly lit and a bit run down but the apartment itself was nice and was a good value for the price.  Nice apartment, fab location. All amenities available and very fast responses. Great value. Fix your door. I cut my hand trying to close it.  The apartment was okay but I wouldn\\'t stay there again. The door knob was missing which made it very difficult to close. The apartment building was not well maintained. Morgan\\'s place was in a safe and somewhat central neighbourhood but unfortunately that was the only highlight of my stay. The noise in the apartment was far less bearable than that of my previous location, which was right in the heart of Williamsburg (Bedford Ave). If it\\'s not the noise of the J or M train, or the people upstairs, it\\'s the constant click of the aircon unit in the main bedroom that doesn\\'t even work. If you\\'re looking for a place to rest your head then the apartment will suffice. Unfortunately there were pans still covered in food and chewed gum stuck to the wall. If the apartment were a little cheaper, I certainly wouldn\\'t have minded all that much.  Emplacement moyen pour le prix et prestations décevantes dans l ensemble.\\nl appartement est grand toutefois Great location and very clean The apartment matched the descriptions in terms of spaces and location. The communication with the host was great in general, and the check in easy.\\n\\nHowever, the location is not the greatest (though that\\'s something you sign up for). There was a strong and unpleasant smell in the building and the apartment, and the pillow cases had some hairs...\\n\\nOther than that, is an okay place to crush for one or two nights. Das Appartement ist sehr viel angenehmer als der Eingangsbereich und das Treppenhaus vermuten lassen. Es ist sauber und alles nötige vorhanden. Das eine Bett knarrt. Das beste ist aber die großartige Anbindung an das Subway Netz. Es bestehen direkte Verbindungen zum Ground Zero und zum Empire State Building und die Haltestelle ist nur 100 Meter enfernt. Great apt, safe neighborhood! (: This place is ideally situated for Manhattan but be aware that the entrance is quite off putting. \\nThe place is clean enough but some common area walls are dirty and leave a bad impression. \\nA space for a cupboard but no shelves was a disappointment and we had quite a hassle getting consistent WiFI although Morgan was responsive. \\nJust a little more effort from the host could make a big difference. I wish Morgan would invest a few dollars in sorting out a few things. \\nNo microwave or toaster that overseas guest might expect. Morgan\\'s apartment was absolutely fantastic. It\\'s a short walk to the M and J trains to Manhattan and is situated in a quiet and safe little neighborhood. The apartment was pristine and offered a lot of space for the price. I\\'ll be sure to stay at Morgan\\'s again next time I\\'m in New York. Highly recommend!!! Not the plushest accommodations but very comfortable,  hospitable and clean. Perfect for a weekend in the city.  Very easy access and communication. Would visit again! Great place if you just need a place to sleep. Two minutes from the subway, it\\'s the perfect place if you\\'re going to multiple boroughs. Very safe neighborhood. \\n\\nJust know that the apartment is on the 3rd floor. Also, there two bedrooms is separated by a curtain, so keep this in mind if you\\'re staying with multiple people. The location is great, safe neighborhood very close to subway and easy to get to Manhattan. The appt is a bit bare bones, but to be expected for the price. The noise from the street was a bit loud at night, but other than that I would stay here again. The apartment smelled badly and had bugs. Good location, smooth check-in. A lot of typical noisy sound outside the apartment. Great place for affordable stay in Williamsbourg! Ailisse’s place is really nice. When we arrived she had snacks and drinks already stocked for us to have at no cost which was a nice touch. The apartment itself was a beautiful apartment. \\n\\nWe did have some issues at first with being asked to pay taxes outside of what we already paid however after confirming with Airbnb it was a legitimate request due to the area. \\n\\nI would stay in this Airbnb again! Ailisse has a wonderful apartment in the heart of the city. She was extremely accommodating and made sure to check in to make sure everything was ok. The apartment was beautiful and clean. I would recommend her to anyone looking for a great place in the city.  Great location. The real New York experience! The apartment is a great way to experience new york city like a local. I lived in nyc so knew what apartments there are like, meaning smaller and usually a bit dated. The apartment was clean, more than large enough for our family of four and with a great location in the village. We were close to everything we wanted to do during our stay. Would definitely stay here again.  Ailisse\\'s place is a great find and I highly recommend it. The location is absolutely amazing and the price point is completely fair. She was very quick with her correspondence throughout the process. 5 stars for sure!  The condo is in a great location and very cosy. Beds are very confortables and the place is clean. The Bar and snacks are very appreciated when you arrived! Being able to have your coffee out of the bed is essential and we loved it. We would definitely book again this condo. \\n\\n Great communication and easy check in. Great location right next to subway entrance. Really enjoyed our stay! Great location.  Apartment could use a bit of maintenance. The place is smaller and older than we see online especially the bathroom. But overall it\\'s a sunny, convenient apartment for a short stay.\\n\\nOur major problem with this stay was check-in, due to the failure of housekeeper\\'s digital key and physical keys, we were stuck in the non air-conditioned third-floor-hallway on a sultry afternoon for at least 30 MINUTES until the manager came over to solve the problem. \\n\\nAfter we checked out the next day, the host reached out to us for a missing apartment key. On the check-in day we confirmed with the manager of the keys we would use for entering the building, so we only took 2 building keys with us, and we had no clue where the extra apartment key was during our whole stay. \\n\\nAfter experiencing all of this, I hope the host could test all the digital and physical keys before check-in to avoid things like this happen again.\\n\\nAs for the cleanness, there were two bath towels offered, but the one hanging behind the bathroom door was wet, so my friend and I decided not to use it. Luckily I took my own towel with me, so my friend could use the one in my bedroom. Have to climb 3 flights of stairs, but great locations and amenities! Ailisse\\'s place is a great value and in a great location. Would definitely recommend staying here! This is not a 5-star experience.  We left after one day of a 5-day booked stay.  The apartment was grimy and very run-down, with non-working lights, dust, mould, peeling paint, exposed wires and so on.  Bedlinen and pillows were very old and/or very tired.  Host offered to send someone around to fix up obvious problems, but they would have taken more time to fix than the length of our booked stay. \\n\\nIn its current state, we could not recommend staying at this apartment. We enjoyed our stay at Ailisse’s place. It was large for NYC, comfortable and nicely decorated. She thoughtfully provided ear plugs. The shower had plenty of hot water. The kitchenette and living area was cozy. We enjoyed take out from the diner below and Joe coffee shop a couple doors down. Ailisse was a fantastic host, great communication throughout the whole process from start to finish and provided timely assistance when we had issues with the door lock. She was also very flexible in terms of letting us store our luggage on arrival and departure to we didn\\'t have to carry it around for hours\\nAilisse\\'s place is in such a perfect location for exploring the best of the West Village and beyond both on foot and with very close proximity to the subway station it was just ideal. Great restaurants, bars and shopping all around the area. Feels like you’re a local. Brilliant location. Great location.  Ailisse was quick to respond. Ear plugs are needed for the street noise at night.   Ate at a couple of the restaurants suggested (Hao Noodle and Waverly Diner) and both were good.  Check in and check out was easy. This is a perfect location in the West Village, close to everything, great to feel like a local for a few days. The kitchen is nice and new and clean- just missing a kettle- but otherwise perfect for making breakfast or any meals. The apartment could use a refresh in paint and in general but otherwise it was super confortable, pretty clean. The beds were confortable and overall we really enjoyed our 5 day stay, after we were finally able to get in. Check-in took almost an hour since the electronic key and code never worked but the owners brother was able to help us over the phone and we managed to get in  and after the initial stress of it all we just used the physical key and never dealt with the electronic lock again which worked out great. If you want a decent place, in the heart of the city, close walk to everything then this is a great option. It is not as crisp or beautiful as it looks in the photos but it is a bright apartment, has a nice sitting area and kitchen, two basic rooms with comfy beds and a hot shower. For us it was much better than staying in a hotel room! Thanks Ailisse! Good communication. Easy check in and out. Great location for my purposes. Good space. No issues. Fantastic location. Good communication on the part of the host when we were setting the trip up. The apartment is adequate- nothing fancy, but has all the necessities. We really enjoyed staying here! Ailisse was really responsive and the space was beautiful. Everything is as described in the listing and the photos are accurate! Great location with local amenities. Beautiful apartment, great location, and very easygoing communication. The apartment is in a great location. Unfortunately, we had a terrible experience at this property. Though Ailisse was an excellent communicator leading up to our stay, the apartment itself was a major disappointment.\\n\\nSpecifically, while the photos on the listing are crisp, bright and near-perfect, the actual apartment is tired, dark and in need of repairs, including a leak and stained ceiling above the front door. \\n\\nI arrived on Thanksgiving Day with my 77 year old mom for a special weekend in NY. After climbing three flights of steep stairs (a detail that had been relegated to the listing disclaimers when we initially reserved the property but that’s now been accurately added to the core description), we walked in the apartment and could not possibly have felt more mislead. The difference between the listing photos and the actual apartment is night and day. \\n\\nWithin 15 minutes of being there, my mom began to have an allergic reaction to something in the apartment. She has a hypothesis about the cause but I’m not including it here because we’re not actually sure about it and I want to stick to the known facts. \\n\\nWhatever the cause, we decided to check out nearly immediately and began our search for a new place to stay on one of the coldest Thanksgiving days in NYC history (yes, the place was that bad). \\n\\nMy hope was to work out an amicable and fait financial arrangement with the host (she had been very kind leading up to our stay), but instead, she shut it down quickly. Great location - a nice “home base” for traveling, quiet and in a great neighborhood but with easy access to public transportation! Enjoyed our stay and would stay again! Apartment was quirky and cozy, though also smaller and shabbier than pictures make it seem. Expensive for what it is. It is in a great location, close to many restaurants and stores and couldn\\'t be more convenient for the subway, which is literally right outside the door.  The diner below is also nice, though it was a bit weird going in and waiting in line to get the key to the apartment.  The worse part for us was the stairs, which were very steep. My partner\\'s older parents, one of whom is in need of a hip replacement, took nearly 15 min to get up the stairs, and almost fell. I don\\'t recall any mention of the steepness of the stairs, or that the apartment was on the 3rd floor, which was really like the 4th, as you had to walk up stairs to get to the 1st floor. It was fine for my boyfriend and I, but would not recommend for anyone elderly or with any type of mobility issues. Would have been an awesome apartment for half the price, but expected a little more for $800/night after taxes, etc. Also, we could not figure out how to make the tv work, and the microwave is faulty and never warmed up our food, even after 5 min, unplugging and resetting. Stephanie was a great host and made sure that the stay went smoothly. Stephanie is a great communicator, using the AirBnB system which alerts you via text messaging.  She wrote us a great e-mail, explaining how to get into her apartment and giving us tips on where to shop, do laundry, etc.  Our plans changed and she rolled with it, including waiting up for us when we got in late!  \\n\\nThe apartment is cozy and clean.  Our room was nicely decorated.  The bed was too firm for us (nothing a memory foam pad wouldn\\'t cure!).  Towels were provided.  We had a very short overnight due to travel plans. Stephanie’s place is a nice place to stay some days in NY. Is very central and clean and She was very helpful. \\nThe only thing I could recommend is to find a better place to put the key. It was no easy for me to follow the instructions and find this little box with the key inside.\\nThank you very much Stephanie for this lovely stay at your home! Stephanie was a great host, even when vacationing out of the country she was very accommodating. Thank you! Es recomendable mejor ubicado no puede estar A great and clean apartment. Stephanie was a great communicator and check in and out instructions were straight forward. The location is easily accessible, and has many great things around it. The Edison parking was affordable and close, Mercato (the small italian restaurant around the corner) was mind-blowing, and public transit was a short walk away.\\n\\nWe would recommend this to anyone looking for a cool apartment downtown and wanting to get a real feel for NYC. We would definitely stay here again! A rock solid stay Perfect location for a short stay in NYC, 10 mins walk to Port Authority. Note there is a building work going on next to the flat, so it will be noisy. The location is great! Very close to Times Square and to grocery, coffee shops, and the subway. \\nStephanie added really nice touches to the apartment and made it really confortable for us. Everything was squeaky clean .\\nThe room was exactly like described and I would definitely stay again in this Airbnb. The appartment is pretty good located in Manhattan and Stephanie is an awesome host and she helped us anytime we needed.\\nWe really recommend the appartment for everyone who visit NY. We had a great weekend in NYC thanks to our stay @ Stephanie’s place! Highly recommended for the neighborhood - great Italian place (Tavola) and Irish pub next door! Modern and spacious bedroom with good bed. Bathroom is small, but everything you need is present. Shared bathroom with one other Airbnb room (2 people). Great place Perfect spot for experiencing NYC! Lovely but small place. Great location though! The apartment location is excellent, just a few blocks from the subway. I couldn\\'t meet Stephanie in person, but she always answered my messages very quickly. \\n  Stephanie’s place was wonderful, warm, and so close to Times Square. She was a great and very kind host who responded to our questions so quickly! We would love to stay here again. Stephanie is really nice and helpful! She responds quickly when you have questions and the check in is very easy  She let us leave our luggage during be day which was really nice.\\n\\nThe room itself is very average. The size of the room is fine, but the rest of the apartment is very small, like a classic nyc apartment. But there is also another room very close and you can hear others very easily. The heater was also a bit loud during the night, so if you’re a sensitive sleeper maybe it’s not the best. It’s also on the 5th floor with no elevator, so with a lot of luggage it’s tricky. \\n\\nBut the location is solid and there is a lot available in the kitchen. It’s also pretty clean. For one night its good! The room was spacious and the kitchen was nice to have. A very small bathroom but nothing out of the ordinary for a city.  The room is located in the 5th floor of an old appartment and there was a construction site near to the appartment, so we had to wake up early in the morning. The check-in was a disaster for us, I hope she changes the lock box. The facilities for cooking were limited. Stephanie is a fair person and I sure that she will do her best to ensure you the best stay as you are awaiting for. Be aware that Stephanie doesn’t live there and that you gonna share the 2 rooms appartement with another guest. GOOD Great appartment in old house. Easy to get/return keys. Easy to get in touch with Stephanie if needed. Calm area apart from a construction site that effects the stay a bit depending on what room you get. El apartamento es tal cual como se muestra en las fotos, es muy acogedor, la ubicación es excelente y se llega muy fácil; además cuenta con todo lo que se pueda necesitar durante la estadía. Stephanie estuvo siempre pendiente de nosotros, contestó nuestras dudas rápidamente y fue muy amable y dispuesta a ayudar. Nuestra estancia fue excelente. Stephanie muchas gracias. The apartment is in a great location to Times Square and all the happenings! Spacious room for 2 people! Would definitely consider staying again! Great place. Just be prepared to climb up a lot of steps lol El departamento es muy pequeño, si hay otros huéspedes no entran 4 personas en la mesa ni en la cocina (único espacio común además del baño). La cama es cómoda y la ducha anda muy bien.\\nTener en consideración que son cinco pisos con escaleras empinadas y angostas lo cual dificulta la subida cuando vienes con muchas maletas.\\nLa habitación que nos tocó tenía dos ventanas con una tela negra que no lograba tapar el sol ni la luz del día. A mi personalmente me dificultó el descanso ya que las ventanas están al lado de la cama y da directamente en la cara.\\nLa habitación es amplia y cómoda. Easy instructions. Great communication. Fantastic location. The location is great since it is near greyhound. There are also lots of restaurant nearby that open late. However, there is a construction next door so it is a bit noisy during the day. Place is located in a great location. Stephanie was very good about communication and she provided everything I needed without issue. I’d defiantly recommend this place to others and would stay again. Very small but very worth it if you\\'re only going there to sleep! Very close to times square and many other attractions. I would definitely stay there again! Het appartement van Stephanie is een aanrader. De plek is ideaal, de kamer is ruimer dan verwacht en zag er netjes uit. Badkamer en keuken zijn wat klein. Ook moet je vijf verdiepingen omhoog, met koffers is dit wel wat zwaar. Kortom een prima verblijf. Great for budget travel! Location is fantastic, Area was safe for me to walk at night with my children :) Essentials are covered with a Market close by to get anything else you need, We cooked dinner once and there is multiple eating choices around, Stephanie is friendly and quick to respond, I also enjoyed saying hello to the other travelers, There was no problem sharing the bathroom or kitchen. Keep in mind apartment is up several flights of stairs and restroom is small so IF YOU ARE OVERWEIGHT it might not be comfortable for you. Otherwise I highly recommend! Wir hatten einen sehr schönen Aufenthalt bei Stephanie! Alles hat super und ohne Probleme geklappt. Was a great stay! Close to so much! Wouldn’t have had it any other way. Steph was an amazing host and gave great detailed directions on how to access the room and also gave great recommendations. 離地鐵與公車站都相當近,很方便! Good:\\nGood location right around the block from the Port Authority bus terminal.\\nReasonably spacious bedroom for NYC.\\nGood exterior light (at least until the nearby construction completes!).\\nReasonably clean.\\n\\nNot so good:\\nCould not reach host to deal with a problem at check-in - no response for 5 hours - very frustrating!\\n5th-floor walk-up (mentioned in reviews, but not in host\\'s description).\\nCrappy mattress wrapped in vinyl. Sticky even in cool weather. Also ill-fitting bottom sheets that would not stay put.\\nTiny bathroom.\\nNot particularly good value (though it seems that the price may have dropped). This place is exactly as described and a great deal. The location is perfect: about halfway between Penn Station and Times Square but also enough off the tourist-path to actually get a bit of the city feel. (The area has some great food options that I wish I had more time to explore) The place is exactly as described....a NYC apartment (5th floor walkup) with a nice, private, LARGE bedroom, with a small bathroom and kitchen. There is also another room in the apartment being rented. Iwas clean enough that I wouldn’t hesitate to stay again. I never spoke with or messaged Stephanie, but I didn’t have to. She gave all the information necessary before I arrived.\\nIf you’re just looking for a safe place to lay you’re head at night you’re probably not going to find anything better for the price! 因提前至民宿放置行李,前房客已退房,所以有看到房間內部,等晚上回到房間時,整間房間大概只放了一條新的浴巾以及簡單鋪床,床單完全沒有更換,睡覺時身體非常搔癢｡窗台甚至還有很久以前留下的乾掉隱形眼鏡｡\\n\\n廁所更是不整潔,非常多毛髮以及凌亂的盥洗用品,潮溼霉味,累了一天卻洗了一場非常不舒服的澡｡\\n\\n地點不錯,但是性價非常不高,寧願多花一點錢去住飯店,好可怕的住宿經驗｡ Responsive and accommodating host.  Centric location. Stephanie\\'s place was perfect for our NYC weekend. The location was awesome, very close to public transportation and within walking distance to so much. It\\'s small (like everything in the city!) but a perfect sized room for the two of us and comfortable bed. Shared with others in the other room but we all must have been out and about all weekend because we never crossed paths. Stephanie got back to me immediately when I asked if we could at least drop our bags before check in, which she didn\\'t mind at all. It was so convenient and I would recommend this place to anyone! il a été facile de contacter Stéphanie avant le séjour (disponible et rapide). nous n\\'avons pas eu besoin de la joindre une fois sur place car tout était clair. le logement correspond à la description, il est bien situé (métro, Times Square, restauration). 2 bémols : les travaux à proximité et la chaleur dans la chambre malgré le ventilateur. The place is nice and clean. Walking distance to time square. The room had a good size. It fitted 3 people with their suitcases. The bathroom was a bit small. The apartment is on the 5th floor and there is no elevator. Stephanie answered quickly and gave clear instuctions for everything! It was a very nice experience!! Una excelente ubicación, nos sentimos seguras, fui con mi hija. Cansada eso sí de subir5 pisos luego de caminar todo el día. Stephanie es amable y siempre dispuesta a ayudar. The location of this place is really great and the check-in was really easy and luckily we could leave our luggage before and after check-in, appreciated! \\nIn general it is a nice but small place. Totally fine for like a night but otherwise it gets a bit small for more than one person, in my opinion. \\nWe enjoyed staying here, only think it is a but pricey for the small and easy place, on the other side I guess that’s just NYC \\u200d♀️ Great location! Check out midtown (liberty) bagel on 35th st. There is no AC so use the fan!!! Comfy bed. Pack lightly, it’s a 5th floor walk up (ie no elevator). Great communication and let me drop my bags/leave my bags late which saved me carrying it all over before my 9pm departure. Great stay. The room we rented was great. We had the bigger room and that was really great for us. However, the fan never really helped us cool the room down. It was extremely warm and humid at night an during the day. The bathroom was much smaller than expected. I’m 5’2ft tall and I was still struggling to move in the bathroom and the shower. It is very well located, everything is walk distance reachable and the area is safe. Would not recommend for family with a stroller since the apartment is located on the fifth floor and the stairs are horrible to climb. Очень милое и живописное место в центре Нью-Йорка. Находясь у Stephanie я почувствовал себя практически жителем этого города. Да, действительно, лестница на 5 этаж сравнительно узка, но ... это, наоборот, добавляет колорита этой квартире. \\nОколо дома Stephanie мы нашли хорошее место для завтрка и всего за 15 минут добрались до остановки мегабаса. \\nРекомендую для других (как минимум, молодых) путешественников!  Great location! Close to a grocery store, lots of food places, easy access to the subway and taxis. Loved it! Abrir la ventana porque hace mucho calor, y falta más comida Great location (8min walk off the nearest Subway station), good amenities and good communication with host, was able to accept a last minute change adding one more person to the room. Downsides: 5 floors of very steep stairs, no elevator, very small bathroom that was not kept very clean and a minor issue with the gas kitchen where the other guests left it on.  Unfortunately we did not have a pleasant experience staying here. We had made arrangements with our host 6 months prior to our trip to be able to check in early and rest up from our red eye flight and have a place to store our luggage for our 1st day, I tried reconfirming the arrangements a week before our trip and did not get a response from our host until less than 24 hours before our flight to be told there was a \"glitch in the system\" (that AirBnb was unable to confirm) that allowed someone else to book the room she had said she would block for us,  so suddenly we were unable to check in early and had no other options for storing our luggage or resting up. Our host offered to store our luggage at a nearby hotel to which she said she would pay for, but upon arriving at the hotel I found out it was only going to be stored with her parents in the hotel room that they were currently staying at. To top it off while in their possession they told me water spilt out of something, everything was wet and books and electronics were ruined... which would not have happened had we been able to check in early and leave our stuff in the room. Once we did make it back to the Airbnb we were met by our host and her parents only to be locked out of the apartment and still unable to check in after 5 PM when regular check in was 4. It was a very frustrating process and not one I would ever want to repeat so I would not stay here again. Stephanie had such a wonderful little room for us!! It was perfect for my sister and me to be able to drop off things in between sight seeing and traveling. The 5 flights of stairs were a little bit exhausting in the heat, but the apartment was nice and air conditioned! The location was perfect- the apartment is only a couple blocks from Times Square as well as the bus station that we used to travel into the city, and several subway lines. Stephanie was so accommodating to our early arrival and late departure which took the stress off of carrying our bags around with us everywhere. Definitely check out 2 Bros. Pizza, it\\'s right down the block! It was a reallt convenient and cheap but delicious little pizza stop. The room was comfy and, for the price, was just what we needed for our one night stay in the city!! Thank you Stephanie! Very pleasant place and nice host ! Tks  ! Great place near times square! I would totally recommend it ! An overall good experience! Great place to stay if you want a simple and true NYC experience. Good instructions are given on how to get into this inner city apartment. A subway station to Central Park is only a block away and Times Square is about 2 blocks away. It’s a bit gritty but the place is cleaned everyday to get you ready for the stay. Great location & Irish pub directly below apt, easy check in and superb communication!  good place, larger than expected, good location. check in process is a little dodgy but that\\'s only at the very beginning and end of the stay\\n Stephanie\\'s place is roomier than many hotels in which we have stayed in Manhattan. Stephanie is fantastic with communication and is very flexible with check-in and check-out times (or at least baggage storage).  We would definitely stay at her place again in the future.  The location of the apartment is awesome!\\nAlso, we have had a lot of pizza in NYC.  Two Brothers Pizza (1.5 short blocks from Stephanie\\'s place) is some of the best we have ever had! Un bon pied à terre pour quelques jours à New York car le logement est idéalement situé.\\nLe logement est conforme à la description et d\\'un très bon rapport qualité prix. . Great location, fast response from Stephanie, all very well organized. I just think that the bathroom needs a bit of a refurbishment. Nous avons séjourné chez Stéphanie et avons été un peu déçus. La situation est super mais nous avons eu du mal à dormir : dans notre chambre, il y avait 2 simples petits morceaux de plexiglas à côté de la climatisation au niveau de la fenêtre si bien qu\\'on entendait tout ce qu\\'il y avait dans la rue et, forcément à  Manhattan, c\\'est très bruyant à toute heure de la  nuit. Manque de chance, nous étions aussi réveillés par nos colocataires qui prenaient des douches en pleine nuit  (salle de bains mitoyenne à la chambre et mal insonorisée). On a finalement mis des boules quies et ça allait mieux. Nous aurions aussi aimé petit-dejeuner sur place même si la cuisine est vraiment petite mais soit cela aurait réveillé nos colocataires quand nous étions debout avant eux, soit cela aurait été compliqué avec seulement 2 chaises alors que nous étions 4. Des petits détails qui laissent une mauvaise impression : par exemple, le rideau de douche avec des traces de moisissures.  C\\'est dommage car Stéphanie a l\\'air très sympa: elle est réactive et donne de bons conseils. Malheureusement, nous ne reviendrons pas dans cet appartement. thanks Stephanie for staying at your Place! we really enjoyed the short Distance to Times Square and the easy check-in/out It was a pleasure to stay in that precious room. Great location! AC in room. 5th Floor with our heavy bags was a challange - no complaints tho. Close to Port Authority. I would definitely stay there next time. Me and my friends had such a great time :) Buena ubicación, departamento en un 5to piso sin ascensor, limpio Stephanie made the check in and check out so easy. We we\\'re able to leave our luggage there after so we can explore the city before our flight. The explanation of the apartment in the description was exactly what we received. Otra persona ocupó nuestra habitación por lo que tuvimos que pasar la primer noche en un cuarto sin apenas espacio para estar, además de que había mucho ruido de un patio interior. al cambiarnos a nuestra habitación, esta era más grande pero el calor era insoportable, además de que también había mucho ruido de la calle. Muy limpio y con instrucciones para todo.\\nLo único es que está en el quinto piso y es pesada las escaleras great place, and great hospitality Quaint little place in perfect location in New York! You get what you pay for. If all you are doing is going to sleep at night then its worth it. The clean house with great location!\\nWe enjoy the whole journey. \\nThanks Stephanie for everything! Parfait pour quelques jours, assez bruyant mais c’est New York! Este alojamiento es super ubicado, limpio, ordenado, cerca de todo lo q quieres visitar, con una fácil llegada y con supermercados al lado This is a great location! The place was clean and just as described. It is a small apartment, but the room had enough space.  The bedroom is quite basic- no TV. For a place to just sleep and shower it is perfect. Stephanie was a great Host and we would book her room again :-) We were disappointed in our stay here. Others need to know that they may be sharing the very small space with other guests. When we walked in, we startled the current guests in the apartment, therefore I\\'m not sure they knew we were arriving that day. The kitchen and bathroom area smelled of urine and there was a musty body odor smell in our room. Cockroaches were found scurrying on the wall in the bathroom that night. We were able to leave our luggage in the kitchen after check out, however our pizza that was left in the refrigerator was thrown out (we hoped to eat this on our way to the airport). We were uncomfortable with the cleanliness during our stay. Good location, but we would not recommend for others unless the place is deep cleaned. L’arrivée était très bien organisée. Le wifi est très performant. La chambre est correcte vu le prix mais la salle de bain n’est pas très propre. Nous sommes restés 1 semaine et avons eu 4-5 colocataires différents chaque ou tous les deux jours. Great and convenient location for NY visit. Stephanie was really communicative and clear about her check-in and check-out instructions. Location is optimal if you\\'re going to spend a lot of time in downtown/lower Manhattan during your trip. There\\'s close proximity to the subway lines which made the rest of the city easily accessible. I also loved how close we were to Penn Station - which made getting back to Newark airport such a breeze! Stephanie\\'s place is optimal in regards to location. Wonderful Very good and clean. Also a great location, a few minutes from Times Square! Great location and super easy to get around. Stephanie has great communication skills and provides easy to follow instructions. If you\\'re a Filipino who craves for Chickenjoy, this is the best place for you. Jollibee is just 300 meters away. 非常好的房子和住宿經驗\\nJonathan回覆訊息非常的快速\\n讓我在最短的時間完成的入住\\n房子非常乾淨 地點也非常好 \\n住起來非常舒適 我很喜歡 像家一樣\\nJonathan兄弟兩人非常的好\\n強力的推薦大家一定要預定他們的房源\\n一定會和我一樣有美好的體驗 I loved this place will be booking in the future very clean host was very good at communicating ! Would recommend ! The Best place in the city book here ! He’s the best In the heart of flushing, a very cozy studio which I highly recommend if staying in Queens. Jonathan is also very quick with responses and easy to reach. Everything was great. The house was spacious and everything looked new (furniture wise). We had up to 5 guests and had nothing but fun. Our only issue was there was no hot water in the bathroom or kitchen, making it hard to shower. Overall we enjoyed our stay. This host was very responsive. Anytime I had a problem during my stay he was right there fixing the issue. He was also very polite and didn’t bother us. The apartment was close to restaurants, shopping and the subway. I believe they called this spot china town. Bed are comfortable not a lot of amenities in the apartment, it is clean but plain and simple It was very comfortable stay. The host was very nice to help with problems.  Great place Thanks for being a Great host. Nice place felt like home jonathan covered for all small needs someone would forget while being on the go. Thank you Check in and out was super easy and quick. Johnathan was quick to respond and was very understanding as we arrived later than expected. The location of the apt is very close to shops and restaurants in the flushing area.. as well as the subway to take you into Manhattan. Bonus the place came with an included parking space for us!\\n\\na few things to note: wifi did not work, very very bare amenities, no hot water for showers (lukewarm at best)..and cleanliness could be better. I had a great stay when I stayed at this property. The owners were great and pleasant will definitely stay there again in the future!! Amazing stay. Didn’t need the stay the night, but got a couple hours of shut eye after a shower. Everything was perfect.  Jonathan also provided me with parking which saved me a lot of time because parking in Flushing in the worst! 100% recommended stay. Host is fast to respond to messages. Check-in was smooth and quick. Good location, close to many restaurants. Clean and spacious apartment. Looks just like the picture! Lovely stay. Jonathan was very attentive and was always nearby. Easy check-in and check-out process, very flexible! Great location, tons of restaurants nearby. Will stay again! 房东人超好 住的这两天很满意 附近有很多好的小吃街 喜欢 必须5分好评 It was just what we were looking for. Convenient and replied very quickly. Check-in was easy and let us check in early because our flight got in so early. Great host!! 一般吧 Love this place, great location, great host, quick response, great apartment.\\nEasy to walk to downtown, no need to drive and park around. Only the noise when people talk and walk around the elevator area is very bothering me.\\nI would recommend staying here, and I will book again for our next trip. Jonathan’s place is great! 位置很方便,但照片与实物有一定出入｡暖气不够暖且速度慢｡但是房主回复及时｡ Cool spot, needed a few more amenities, tough if you have a car. Great location if you like asian culture an food. His place was amazing. When I entered the complex my phone automatically connected to WiFi. It seems like I have been here before. I asked for extra blankets last night and I fell asleep. He quietly came in and put the blanket over me and tucked me in. Jonathan, I think is a great guy. Easy to communicate but condo is dirty, smells bad. This condo needs renovation and deep cleaning. Condo Description and inside doesn\\'t match at all. Jonathan responded quickly and was very accommodating. Also, there was reasonably-priced 24 hour parking right across the street from his place which was worked out great. Nice simple no frills space. No curtains on the windows in the living room. Kitchen was a bit dirty but nothin insurmountable. Overall a good stay. Would visit again if needed 중국인과 한국인 밀집지역에 위치해 있습니다. 맨하탄에 머물게 아니면 괜찮은 선택입니다 Cozy and convenient. I unexpectedly had to cancel my reservation at Jonathan\\'s place.  I was aware of his strict cancellation policy but still tried to reach out to see if my situation fell under extenuating circumstances.  No reply.  I\\'ve never had a host just not reply to a direct message.  I then had to reach out to Airbnb to see if they could help.  I understood if I couldn\\'t receive a refund but it was very discourteous not to receive a reply after two attempts to try to reach Jonathan.   Especially since he is gaining income from a 4-night stay that never occurred one would hope for at least some acknowledgement to the situation.  If he had simply replied back to my private message saying no then I could have saved time in reaching out to customer service. Great coffee & breakfast just around the corner at Tous de Jour! Great location, very easy to communicate with the host.  地點很方便 N Very comfortable apartment The apartment is a good value at a good location.  Check in is easy and communication with the host is great.  We are coffee addicts and missed not having a coffee pot.  We had everything else we needed.  Parking is challenging.  Street parking is highly competitive.  There is a ramp around the corner that charges $23/day which is pretty good in New York.  Location is awesome.  We walked to Citi Field, less than a mile.  The heart of Flushing, with its big Korean community, is just around the corner.\\nThere is a security entrance to the building, so you feel safe in the building.  No bugs.\\nWe would stay there again. The place is really nice. The location is perfect. Short walking distance to the main station. Jonathan response very quickly for any inquiries.  Cet appartement fut excellent pour nous. Près du stade des Mets et tranquille le soir. Bien aménagé et propre. J’y retournerais sans hésitation. Jonathan est également très rapide et courtois pour répondre à toutes questions. Jonathan responded immediately at 8:30pm when my family got stranded at LaGuardia and needed a place to stay the night. A lifesaver! very quick responses, the place was clean and had everything needed. the view on the balcony is a beautiful touch. would stay again. \\n\\nthanks again Great location and good value. Located close to Metro 7 line, perfect for getting into the city. Check in was easy and efficient. Check out was the same. Place was relatively clean. 2 cozy beds. Not enough towels or blankets but we brought our own. No issues and again, can\\'t beat the price! Great location and amenities in Flushing, good choice for family tour in NYC. Spacious apartment, decent neighborhood, but no curtains in the living room 第二次入住了,房东很nice,一切都非常好｡ It is a good place to stay. There are many good restaurants around. It is also very convenient because train station is like 10 mins away, and the line 7 can take you to Manhattan in 40 mins. Good place...definitely have a stay...chill place for gathering and having fun!!! 非常棒的地理位置,出行方便,房东人很好｡由于2次入住,我们在这个间隙还把不方便带走的物品寄放于房东家｡非常感谢房东的帮助｡ \\nTerrible unit!  It’s an apartment not a condo!  This part of Queens is really run down with no street parking!  The apartment is befitting of the\\narea as well for the following reasons:\\n1. The windows were not air tight so the owner fixed them using brown Packaging tape\\n2. The air conditioning units were wrapped using black electrical tape \\n3. The patio door was fixed with packaging tape I guess to keep the air out\\n4. No smoke detectors in apartment for safety\\n5. Stove and refrigerator nasty \\n6. Alarm system was hanging from the wall.  \\n7.  Host check in stated “the door is open” no keys or key in or out code!  \\n8. No working lamps in bedrooms \\n9.  Tv equipment/cable box hanging from tv no stand or remote for tv\\n10. the building has chains on the doors and paper on the windows and the entry way still had a Christmas tree standing in July and the front desk looked abandoned with non working items such as the phone system. \\n11.  Cheap furnishings and bedding\\n\\nWhat I do appreciate is that the host returned 100% of our money! \\n Overall, a positive experience! Though if you plan on cooking much, you will find it challenging as I only found one wok with which to work. It also gets very hot during the summer days in the living area. Building felt safe, as well as the surrounding area. There are loads of restaurants within a two minute walk, and a bit further down is more shopping and a mall! It\\'s definitely furnished very basically, but had the necessities. Street parking is definitely a challenge, but we knew that going in! There is a parking garage only half a block away which is very convenient, if pricey ($24/day). The street itself was very quiet, as was the actual building! The only noise is from the air traffic due to the airport nearby. It didn\\'t bother or disturb us at all, but anyone sensitive to noise at night might find it bothersome. Jonathan was quick to respond and helpful when we had an issue with the key.  挺好的,性价比高 The unit is clean, and the location is very good. Jonathan is also very responsive.  everything was good The place is in a quiet area just off of Union St and near all the great food of Flushing Chinatown. The place has two elevators making the high floor great to reduce street noise. Make suree to enjoy the best Chinese food in the country which is found in Flushing. Very convenient location if you want to be close to the US Open tennis tournament or Citi field. Functional and ideal for a family of 4. The bedrooms are airconditioned but the living room isn\\'t. Jonathan is a very responsive host. The building doesn\\'t seem to be very well maintained but an elevator is available. Jonathan is extremely responsive and accommodating! We booked on short notice and he stayed in contact with us the entire time! Very clean unit! Very nice and comfortable. \\n100% recommendation Nice place ;Jonathan did his best to accommodate our needs.I would rent it again if needed. Jonathan’s home is comfortable and convenient. The room is very spacious. And it is close to subway and supermarket. We have a nice stay. 房间热水问题一直没有解决,我们随行四个人,洗澡很不方便｡只有第一晚有热水,给房东打了很多电话,房东都不知主动联系｡感觉很不好 The location is amazing and very convenient to the shopping mall and subway station. Jonathan was very responsive and helpful with everything I needed during my check in/check out and our entire stay there and brought us an iron while we were out. Only complaint is that one of the showers fill up very quick while you’re taking a shower (past your ankles). Also, there were no washcloths for showers or washing up. The neighborhood is very nice and the place comes with free WiFi and Netflix! Thanks Jonathan! Place was in a great location about 5 minute walk to Main Street Flushing. Problem was just 1 couch for everyone may 1 more furniture would be good. Also TV works but no channels and controller had no batteries. Then the panels on the walls on the floor just need some fixing. Other than that plenty of towels were ready, linen was clean, a/c worked great, overall clean place. The listing won\\'t tell you but the apartment is in Queen\\'s chinatown. The kitchen microwave was really nasty. The towels had faint stains and did not look clean. The remote control for TV had one missing battery. The main door knob was problematic and we were once locked inside and our morning plan was spoiled. The host had to come and get us out. The window on one of the bedroom won\\'t shut completely so the air conditioning in that room was not effective. The living room does not have blinds or curtains. The apartment is very close to Laguardia airport and the noise of flights landing and taking off make sleeping difficult. I do not recommend this place to stay.  My experience was so bad that I am thinking about using Airbnb again. How does this place has some good reviews god only knows. Pros: good location near food, shopping, and the train station. Spacious. Nice working elevator. Nice host. Heat works. Quiet. Jonathan responds pretty quickly. \\n\\nCons: weird smells coming from the exhaust fan in the kitchen (while we were there, we smelled neighbors burning food and smoking cigarettes). All 3 beds are uncomfortable. Bathrooms need a major cleaning and there was black mold on the shower curtain. Dishwasher had mold in it. Need some curtains or blinds in the living room and more towels. More towels would be helpful. We had 4 bath towels for 4 people, which was fine, but we could\\'ve used a couple hand towels or a towel in the kitchen.. or even paper towels (which we ended up purchasing at the pharmacy down the street). It was very clean and a great location, it’s attached to an office space though but is still very private. Great for the price! Very clean and great location. PJ was very communicative and gave great directions for check in Nice place, extremely clean, quiet close to restaurants and 33rd Street Path. Great value and communication. Such a great location, a block away from Macy’s, transit, and etc. The place was perfect for my short stay. Thank you!! Great value and location, especially if you want to stay close to Penn Station.  Lots of restaurants and shopping nearby.  Easy check in and great communication, thank you! PERFECT LOCATION! If you are not from NYC, believe me when I say this is the heart of the city. It\\'s a 12 min walk from Grand Central, 2 minute walk to the NQRW, easy and quick to Chelsea, Upper East Side, and anywhere else you want to go, but also TONS of things close by. Also, the apartment is fully equipt with glasses, knives, iron, and the wine opener really saved us! It is a simple apartment, but clean and comfortable. My friends and I would all stay again, and also recommend to our friends! It\\'s a cheap studio.  But it is clean, convenient, and incredibly low-priced.  If you\\'re looking for a low-cost place to stay in NYC, this is an excellent choice.  \\n\\nOther positives-\\nThe blankets and pillows PJ provided are very comfortable and good quality.  \\nPJ was extremely responsive when I had trouble with the access code, took  less than five minutes to get things sorted and into the apartment.\\nBathroom was very clean. The place was clean and comfortable. It’s a large room with two beds and even a back door to go outside. The good: The host was very nice, it\\'s super central, the room was relatively quiet. The bedding was nice and clean.\\nThe weird: Calling this place an apartment is really a stretch: it\\'s the backroom of a luggage storage business. There are basically no windows, and there are other guests in a different backroom. \\nThe bad: One day the shower was cold. I saw a roach in the bathroom. It\\'s very dark and generally not a pleasant place. Es el lugar adecuado, cómodo, limpio y con la mejor ubicación en pleno corazón de Manhattan. Cerca a los mejores lugares para llegar caminando o abordar cualquier tipo de transporte!!! Amazing location and can\\'t beat the price! Great base while exploring the city. Close to Central Park, Empire State, and subway. Very convenient check-in and out. Great room and location Amazing location! The space is a little small and old, but since we spent a big part of our time outside, it didn’t bother us at all. Besides, the price is good. Good location, decent value for the location. Some issues with the radiator leaking onto the floor. Radiator was very noisy at night, so woke up throughout the night. Issue with hot water the first night; otherwise, hot water was fine the second two days. Great space, very clean and great location Great Location! It was a nice place in a great location. It was a nice enough place for us to come back from a long day and get some rest- then be ready for the next day. Very close to lots of great stuff! Recommended! My family and I recently stayed at PJ\\'s for three nights and are very happy with the location and cleanliness of the place. It\\'s very accessible from Penn Stn and to major attractions around town. The only imperfection I can point it is that hot water supply for shower is slightly limited. For the three of us we can\\'t have more than four mins shower each or the hot water would runs out. So it might not be for those wanting long shower. I\\'ll definitely stay at PJs again next time. Amazing location! We walked pretty much everywhere! The ability to check our luggage the day we checked out without even going anywhere was great while we did some last min sight-seeing! It was my husband who stayed there. When asked how was his stay, he said “its wonderful”. Never had a problem locating it and PJ\\'s very accommodating and responsive. I even got a text message here in the Philippines informing me to tell my husband that the room was ready Great little gem in a great location. Good value place for sure! Muy cordial, y la ubicación es inmejorable! En el centro de todo Great place that is in a perfect location to visit the whole city and not far from anything! PJ\\'s place is a good, centrally located option for travelers on a budget.  It’s not a private studio AT ALL! The room is in a shared space with the rest of the apartment residents and you will see random people doing laundry etc. The room itself is actually behind an office and PJ will be watching you with cameras and will aggressively text you if you disobey house rules. If you stay here, be prepared to be watched and stay in a very dusty room that looks like an old classroom was converted and the WiFi is also terrible  A simple studio type room smack in the middle of Manhattan. Empire State is just around the corner. 5-10 minute walk to Time square. 3 minute walk to Bryant Park and NY Public Library. Very near to Herald square if you want to do shopping. Very much a good spot. Complete with basic things you need. Highly recommended. :) Incredible location, plenty of space for our party of 3. We brought an air mattress that fit just fine. Would highly recommend to other travelers on a budget. We enjoyed our stay here. It’s a great place and location.  We had a little trouble with communication,  but we would gladly stay here again. Pj’s place is just as advertised and he was an accessible and quick-to-respond host. The location is excellent-easy access to most parts of Manhattan.  Outdoor space is limited but if you’re looking for a clean, well positioned place to be the launch pad for your New York adventure this will do just fine, especially for the price. I was very disappointed in my stay., especially for the price.  There were 2 outlets in the room on opposite sides of the room.  Neither were very accessible.  I had to charge my phone across the room.  Not a big deal, right?  Unless your in bed!   I had to get up and walk across the room every time I received a text or call.  The bedside lamp and alarm clock were useless because there was no outlet for them to be plugged into.  Lamp didn’t work once it was plugged in.  Power strip provided was broken.  TV service is provided by RABBIT EARS! USELESS!   When I asked for assistance with this I was told by the staff member that people don’t usually watch tv, they go sightseeing. WiFi was unavailable for more than half of my stay.  Check in and check out were great, very accommodating. Great location.  Clean.  Good communication by Pj.  A one night pass through for me.  Not perfect but good value.  I would come back.  Thanks. PJ answered really fast which was fantastic since we contacted him about needing accommodation the day before our trip. The location was awesome, the room looked like the picture and it was clean. Over all a very pleasant experience. We found roaches in the apartment.  The air conditioning unit did not cool the room. It was consistently 85-95 degrees in the room. It was noisy because of the non functioning air conditioning. The only thing this place has going for it is the easy check in and its location. Small fan and small stand up Air condition unit. Room stood around 85 degrees. Was cooler outside than inside the entire day if not the same. At night it’s cooler to leave the balcony door open with noise then to rely on what’s in the room. Location is good for trains or walking downtown. I am saving this spot for the future! It is an excellent steal in the middle of mid-town. great for solo travelers or anyone looking for an authentic experience on a budget. It is secure and extremely convenient. The only reason I did not give the full four stars was because of an unfortunate hiccup with the AC that left water all over the floor while I slept. Unlike other reviewers, I will say that the apartment did get very, very cool! But the water combined with that left me ill... Hopefully, PJ will have the AC fixed for the next guest! First I will say this is my first Airbnb experience (even though I have firsthand experience in being a Airbnb host (obviously my expectations were different from what I\\'ve seen provided as opposed to being a renter.)\\nI was there for business reasons and to watch the All Star game (on Fox network which is part of any basic television service). \\n\\nI\\'ll first look at the Amenities:\\n\\nTowels - only one provided, no face cloth\\nBed Sheets- NONE, had to use blanket and pillows with no case\\n\\nSoap - yes (but the shower dispenser did not work)\\n\\nHot Water - yes, very hot.\\n\\nIron - yes (in fact there are 2 of them. NO Ironing board\\n\\nWorkspace - Yes, excellent\\n\\nTV - worst selection I have ever encountered. If you plan to watch TV, stay away. In fact, the host told me to bring my own TV (!). The most up to date show i found was Barney Miller (1970\\'s show). No local stations, no network TV. As mentioned, I looked forward to watching a Baseball game and could not. It is 2018 - basic TV (cable or HDTV antennae should be provided. There is a rabbit ear antennae there.\\n\\nWIFI - was fine, use 5g network, not what it says to use\\n\\nFridge and microwave - yes, did not use either\\n\\nBed Linens - NO. Blankets only, no pillow case nor sheets. \\n\\nHair Dryer - yes, did not use\\n\\nHangers - yes\\n\\nShampoo - yes\\n\\nMy Other comments:\\n\\t- No plug access on night table, unplug clock\\n\\t- Was not clean, was misled about that. Bathroom is dirty.\\n\\t- AC is there and loud\\n\\t- One main power plug with extension cord that can be dangerous. Example - when plugging in PC, the cord is on the floor in the room.\\n\\t- There were coffee filters, no coffee maker. If you drink tea, everything is there for you. If you drink coffee, there is nothing. When I mentioned this, the host bought a new coffee maker for me, nice response!\\n\\t- No windows.\\n- Expect a Dorm Room experience.\\n\\t\\n Great value for a quick visit or sightseeing trip. Anything you need is close by. Will definitely stay again.  PJ was very accommodating without check in and available for all questions. The place was very clean and comfortable. It has a portable air conditioner which keeps place really cool and provides white noise...we slept like babies!  There’s everything you need in the place and it was very clean. The stairs were quite steep but that seems common in NY. We only stayed one night but would use again if in NY in future.  For the price/location, awesome place. Good location, amenities were better than I expected after reading previous reviews. TV is not really that great but we didn\\'t come for that, so if that is an issue for others maybe it is something to consider. Be mindful that the host is strict about number of guests and check-in/check-out times. excellent position! just a little problem  with check in because we got the wrong keys but PJ suddenly solved. The apt was clean and comfortable.   This was my first trip to New York and as I was searching for places, this one caught my eye because of location, price (I had to book a place last minute), and it had such high rated reviews. I wish that I had read through the reviews more thoroughly though because we (me and my friend) were pretty shocked when we first got there. I knew we’d be living dorm-style, which was fine. We needed a place to sleep mostly so tons of space wasn’t a priority. But as we got into the building, we felt pretty sketched out. It’s basically a tiny dorm room randomly shoved in the back of an office up a flight of super steep stairs. The “outdoor space” in the description was a back door that lead to a janky balcony (that feels like a generous word). It also had a flight of outdoor stairs coming up that lead to a creepy dilapidated courtyard between the buildings. I was very concerned about this as it didn’t feel entirely safe. We kept the door locked the whole time and didn’t dare walk out in case someone saw we were there and came for us at night. Seriously, those were the vibes. The only positive things that I have to say about this place is that it’s location, as far as things to do and see, is phenomenal. It’s within walking distance to great shopping, sightseeing, and the subway. We were also able to leave our luggage there for the day because checkout was way earlier than our flight home. \\nThis may sound sexist but if you are a single woman or even two women traveling, DO NOT STAY HERE. We did not feel entirely comfortable but felt obligated to stay because of their strict refund policy. We should have left and demanded a refund. I really regret not just doing it but I sucked it up. If you’re a woman traveling with a man or a couple dudes traveling together, have at it, just know there’s a reason it’s so cheap.  Instructions about check-in and out were communicated in time and detail! The location is excellent. The apartment is very clean. It’s of great value for its cost! Un bon endroits à Manhattan pour profiter de NY Pj\\'s apartment is in a great location-right in the middle of everything! It was clean, quiet and comfortable. PJ was very nice and easy to work with. I will definitely stay here again! Super convenient location!\\n\\nThe host was very prompt in his responses. He made sure we had the correct check in instructions. (I was arriving 2 days later, my friends arrived first). When my friends didn\\'t respond he made sure one of us had the correct check in instructions. \\n\\nHe was very friendly and also showed my friends the way to our place when they arrived first. My stay at the apartment was great. Centrally located and right next to a good bar for dinner Just be careful to ask (in writing) any questions or concerns you have and get commitment from PJ and what he is willing to do and make sure he follows through.  He was not very honest or responsible in my opinion. Very clean, cozy and convenient. PJ is very responsive and a great host. Thank you! For those looking for a comfortable but no frills crashpad in midtown, this studio is for you. Quiet room with a couple of comfortable beds and a three quarters bath. The linens were quality and PJ himself was very polite even with my missing my connection and arriving over three hours late. Painless, combination check-in process. I\\'d stay again when making a quick 36 hour business trip. Nice little place conveniently located within walking distance of ESB and Penn Station. In the heart of Koreatown by numerous, great places to eat and shop PJ is a very communicative, generous host. His place is well located In a safe and vibrant neighborhood with lots of amenities. A really great value! The good thing about the room is the excellent location, central and well connected. The beds were very comfortable and has its own bathroom.\\nThe bad is practically everything else: glasses, plates and cutlery with remains of food and drink.\\nWe found a cockroach in the room, they did not takr out the garbage until the second time we asked for it.\\nThe room had a small window that could not be opened and a door that opened onto a yard full of rubbish.\\nThis made it impossible to ventilate the room properly, which smelled closed and was very hot. It was also very noisy because of the air conditioners and because the yard was the back of a bar.\\nIt had pans but no kitchen element to be able to cook. And there was no room to wash the dishes we used, so we would scrub them in the bathroom and let them dry in the shower. \\nThere isn\\'t a studio is like a hostel with a room with private bathroom. And sometimes the office\\'s door was open and we thought was unsafe. good location, bathroom a bit unpleasant with the smelly shower curtain, but other than that its fine Ce n’est pas un appartement ni un «\\xa0logement entier\\xa0» mais une piece au fond d’une société. \\nAppartement bruyant (air conditionné extérieur + voisinage). \\nAppartement sale, j’ai été surpris par un cafard sur mon lit en m’endormant... \\npour 150€ la nuit...\\nPar contre très bien placé, collé à l’empire state building. \\nPour ceux que la saleté et le bruit ne dérangent pas.. In our opinion this place is a real jem comparing to other NY accommodations.\\n\\nThe Pros:\\n-Amazing location (15min to Broadway theaters and Times Square, 3min to Subway, 10min to empire state building), feels very safe at night as well. \\n-Just 2nd floor so not a lot of climbing up the stairs with your luggage.\\n\\nThe cons:\\n-if your sleep is light take into account there is a noisy air con engine roaring from outside, also the air con in the room is noisy... Pj provided ear plugs (But we sleep easily so we didn\\'t have problem sleeping without them)\\n-There is no real kitchen (no sink or gas), so prepare to eat outside :) Nice enough place, everything we needed, and great location. Just a heads up, this is a room in the back of a laundry mat. It’s a business these guys are running essentially like a hotel but calling it an AirBnB. The door to the room is a bedroom door, thin and flimsy and there’s no deadbolt. I didn’t feel safe staying here so I left. Pj\\'s place was exactly as we expected. There weren\\'t a lot of bells and whistles, but that\\'s not why we were in NYC. It was the perfect home base for all of our sight-seeing adventures. The location is PHENOMENAL!!! We were even able to save a little money by preparing breakfast a few mornings because we had access to a refrigerator, toaster, and microwave. If you are looking for a place to lay your head without a lot of frills, Pj\\'s place is perfect. L’appartement de Pj était très propre et correctement équipé pour un petit séjour (pas de cuisine mais micro onde, bouilloire, frigo et cafetière). Il est très bien situé à quelques pas de l’empire State building. L’appartement donne sur une cour intérieur un peu bruyante à cause des clims mais malgré cela je recommande cet appartement. This location is unbeatable. PJ was absolutely awesome with communication. Can’t say enough good things. Excellent location. The place offers everything you need for a comfortable and convenience stay in NY. I\\'ll stay there again next time I\\'m in NY. The place is on a great location. Noise (like snoring) can be an issue since you’re sharing a space with 3 other people separated by a curtain. This place is more like a  Hostel rooms are very small . Good thing is it\\'s close to everything  You want. Don\\'t know if I would say there again The place is OK if you are in the mood of not staying for long at the room and going out and get to know some of New York\\'s major attractions which are very close.\\nWhat you get is not actually a room, but a bed and a desk trapped between walls (literally no space between the 1 person bed and the wall) a wall that doesn\\'t go up to the roof completely, providing zero privacy (you can hear your neighbours snoring, can\\'t have a phone conversation, etc). That being said, value is ok, as again, you are close to everything in an area where rooms can get up to hundreds of dollars. Cool place. Great location. If you don\\'t mind the open area and tiptoeing around it\\'s a good spot. Just really cold all the time... they should put heaters in the (Website hidden by Airbnb) so cold it\\'s a struggle. Rather than save a few bucks the owners should definitely invest in small fan/heaters. Great place. I would stay again. It\\'s not the Ritz but it works for the avid explorer or someone who needs to be forced out into the world . Genius space. 숙소의 위치가 찾기 쉬웠고 중심가에 위치하고있어 도보로 미드타운 일대를 다닐 수 있어서 좋았습니다. 다른 지역으로 가는 것도 서브웨이 스테이션이 숙소와 인접해있어서 여행하기에 최적의 위치를 갖고 있었습니다^^ It\\'s cheap and good location. Good economic place iyi warehouse Pretty neat, clean, functional, to the point. Loved it. Its a trapped Great location. Nina place was good for the cost. The room is like a closet space tho. The room was clean and was given complementary towels.  While the room is tiny, it is exactly like advertised. It was clean, and the bathroom was also clean. No complaints here. Great location! Good location, very tiny space, fine environment. A cheap and decent choice to stay at Manhattan Nina was an attentive host, and answered any questions as needed. The one thing that I absolutely loved was the quality bed, which felt like sleeping in a marshmallow.  The location is excellent, walking distance to Penn Station, easy subway ride up to Times Square, and a few blocks from Macy\\'s.  One result of being so close to everything is the street noise in the apartment.  However, it\\'s nothing major, and every New Yorker knows that\\'s the sacrifice for convenience.  Still, Nina was kind enough to leave ear plugs, if needed.  As described in other reviews, the room is a partition and shared with other guests, so you would need to be mindful of noise and light and hope that the other guests are too.  Overall, for location and accommodations, this place was a great stay. Location is perfect, check in and instructions perfect, a block away from the Empire State Building. Can’t wait to go back! everything was great! The place  was worth the money. Really good location, wifi was good and the place was clean. The host was also really helpful and responded fast with concerns. Nice place Hi everyone, I highly suggest Nina\\'s place because it is the perfect place if you want to stay in the center on NYC. The Times Square is just ten minutes walk form the place. The price is affordable, comfortable sheets, super clean bathroom!!! I enjoyed my stay at Nina’s place. The location is excellent and I got good instructions for the self-check-in. Exactly as described. Small space with very comfy bed. Other guest could be a tad loud during the day. Very comfy bed. It\\'s pretty much a hostel. Nina’s place was great! It’s nothing fancy but it’s the best deal you’ll find in NYC for the location. I’ll definitely be coming back! The place was exactly as described on Airbnb. It was clean, had amenities including fridge, microwave etc. The host was very receptive and provided accurate instructions for the room. Will definitely stay here again. Thank you Airbnb and Nina Le logement est conforme à la description, Nina répond très vite, après pour ce prix, il ne faut pas s\\'attendre à du luxe, c\\'est même plutôt l\\'inverse ici mais difficile de faire moins cher en plein cœur de Manhattan donc très bien pour poser ses affaires et dormir (si on est pas claustrophobe et qu\\'on met les boules quies qui sont fournis) Great location, Easy to communicate, Clean and nothing to complain. It will be a great choice for you if you want to stay in the heart of New York and save money! Nina\\'s communication and follow-up was fantastic. Wonderful place to stay in NYc. Close to everything. Great place to stay, very close to everything 可以清楚听到隔壁做私事､打呼噜和电话的声音｡隔壁很可能半夜开着灯,导致你的房间半夜很亮,而你无能为力｡\\n你不能很好的打电话或者大声做事,因为房间的声音可以完全传出去｡\\n墙不是完整的,只是一块板,且房间与房间之间的上面相通｡\\n\\n位置良好,但是黑人和流浪汉在附近很多｡晚上楼下是酒吧｡ Good place with an excelent locación. Very accommodating host, thanks a lot!  You’re getting what you pay for. It’s a great location, good price, but essentially the bare minimum. If you’re exploring New York the way I was, that works perfectly. Just hope that the guests around you don’t snore - one of mine did and the earplugs only help so much! Good stay Good La ubicación es realmente maravillosa, si bien es un lugar muy pequeño, vale la pena por el precio y por la ubicación, además si vas a Nueva York no te la vas a pasar todo el tiempo en tu habitación. Perfect location The place is just as advertised. Great location, within walking distance of Tmes Square and all the other landmarks of New York. Staying in the centre of the city let me explore the heart of the city by walk at all hours. i even managed to squeeze in a run till the United Nations building early one morning. There is a diner almost next door that serves very good breakfast. Wifi is blazing fast.  Great place for a cheap stay. It’s my third time back and it’s always a good experience. Amazing location. Electronic doorlock, so you can check in at any time after they clean the room. Comfy bed, small room. Some amenities like iron, fridge available. The low walls can make sleeping hard if you don\\'t use the provided earplugs. Place is totally fine, and reasonably clean. You’re getting what you pay for, cheep and good location.  Check in is done with codes/lock box, which is convenient. Great stay Excellent location, great price and easy to self-check in. Just great for one night Good value for NYC, but just be aware these are extremely basic accommodations, pretty much a hostel.  It\\'s a cubicle with a small bed, walls open at top so you can hear other guests and see their lights, kind of hot...  If you\\'re used to hostels and just need a place to sleep, you\\'ll be fine.  Check in was very easy with codes and lock box. Host was good with communication during the day.\\n I would not recommend staying at this Airbnb. I ended up not staying here because of the cleanliness of the room. The Airbnb itself is actually a luggage storage business that you had to walk through to get to the room. The room itself is a closet at the business (which I think is illegal). Literally just a bed. No air conditioning and no lights in the room. Definitely spend the extra money on a hotel room.  The place is good for those who are looking to save money when staying in NY. It is pretty basic and the bed is somewhat hard to sleep. If you are a light sleeper the noises from other guests can be an issue. The walls are pretty thin and don’t go up to the ceiling. The washroom can use some cleaning. Otherwise for a quick stay for the price and location can’t ask for more.  The place is in a great location, on a walking distance to many interesting sites in Midtown, and close to the public transportation.\\nThe communication with the host was great. \\nThere are 4 rooms separated from a taxi/luggage office by a door. You have to go through the office to get to the washroom. \\nThis room is very small and fits better a small and slim person. \\nSince the walls don’t connect to the ceiling, you can hear everything people on the other rooms are doing and they car hear everything you do. For this reason, you also can’t make phone calls in the room neither turn on the lights after midnight. \\nI recommend this place to who is looking for a quick stay in a great location, but don’t mind the lack of privacy and lack of space.  Great Host was very quick and responsive. Very friendly too. Definitely a nice spot for one person. Very secluded in its own spot. Nice location where you can walk to anything. Don’t expect a lot of space though, it’s very small but it works wonder if ya need a last minute space for another night in the city. Tight space but great to lay your head Comfortable bed at a location central to a lot of places in Manhattan. Small bedroom but the location is great, really clean and cheap. Get what you pay for super great location! Great centric location, just be aware that sound isolation between rooms is very low, and that those rooms are really small Good location. Although I was not able to turn on the light in my room, I was satisfied. It was a small room with a bed and a table. I recommend you to prepare eyemasks because it was too bright to sleep due to stree lights through the window. It was a good stay This was precisely as advertised. Great for needing a place to sleep right in the heart of the city. This room was exactly what I expected for a solo trip. The pictures give you the perfect idea of what you\\'re paying for and it was actually cozier than I expected. I found it clean enough but there are slippers provided if you need them. \\n\\nThe other guests kept to themselves and I hardly ever saw them. The bathroom was always free for me when I needed it. The walls around the bed were lower than I expected and on some nights the other guests kept their lights on hours past the midnight curfew. Enough to annoy me but it didn\\'t ruin my night. If you\\'ve ever had quiet roommates you know what to expect. The webpage also lists complimentary soap and shampoo which I did not receive so I had to buy my own.\\n\\nStill the location is in my favourite part of the city and since I was travelling alone the value was too good to pass up. There are four doors that are always kept locked so I always felt safe. When I travel to New York again I will definitely be checking out this space again. Good room for the Price. The place is fare with a good location but really small and I couldn’t feel privacy or quietness due to the rooms setup and noise from street Hard to beat the location/price combo. Not the most ritzy place, but if you’re mostly looking for a place to shower and sleep, it’s great. It also has a desk and wifi if you need to get anything done. Great deal Cheap place to sleep Great value. As advertised, it\\'s a pretty solid place for the price and location Good place excelente para venir a visitar NY la hospitalidad es excelente Amazing location and cleanliness. Good value. Recommended for solo travelers Good place for the money, bring an eye mask and some ear plugs, you can hear all the other guests and their lights may keep you up. Conforme aux attentes. Bien placé.\\nBon rapport qualité prix Nice place Good place. Great location and clear instructions. It\\'s a nice little room. Really central! Would recommend for a short stay or just as a place for the night. Probably my concept of privacy is different from the average newyorker but to me this room is not private at all, the pictures don’t show that the beds are just surrounded by 2m tall cardboard walls with 1m open gap from the top of the wall to the ceiling, so you are basically sharing a big room with 3 strangers that you can’t see but definitely can hear every movement you make. Other than that the location is great, right in the center of manhattan. Just disappointed by the (non) separation of the rooms. The place is good.\\nAnd Price is also good. Simple room, quiet place, great location! Cheap, you get what you pay for. You get exactly what you see :)\\nAnd in my opinion it\\'s the perfect place to stay for a small amount of money in the heart of Manhattan. Room and Bathroom were both clean and tidy and there wasn\\'t a problem to bring my luggage earlier or leave it there after the check out.\\nThe rooms are small but I only was there to sleep and so I don\\'t care about their seize :)\\n\\nI can recommend this place! 저렴하고 좋았습니다. Great for single travelers and quick trips. La location est excellente. Elle est au centre Manhattan (midtown) , 5-6 mins à pied à Times Square. C’est une très bonne place pour un célibataire (Homme) qui voulait voyager en court période. L’endroit est propre ( la salle de bain partagée à l’extérieur ).\\n\\nDéfaut: dans ton chambre, t’attend bien que t’es voisins ronflent.\\n\\nC’est un trade-off. Personnellement, je suis une personne qui pourrait dormir très bien après la visite d’une journée à extérieur. Mais pour ceux qui est sensible au bruit, ici, peut-être pas une très bon coin pour vous. The location is perfect 5mins walking to Times Square but the room is too small and you can hear everything from other rooms. Place is ok if you are planning to stay for one or two days The ad made it clear that the rooms are not completely closed-off/private, as the walls do not go all the way to the ceiling. Unfortunately the person in the next room both left his light on all night (making the entire area lit) and had his alarm go off beginning at 6:30 AM, meaning that his alarm went off for me as well, both of which were violations of the rules. If the host is going to provide rooms in that condition, they have to hold guests accountable. Why should one guest be able to make the living situation for another impossible, with no consequences? The moment you are unable to sleep, the room\\'s low price becomes way too high. Great location, close to everything.\\nNice for solo travelers. The price is reasonable and everything is okay. Thank you so much. Thx Nina! Again, remember to vote for me for Governor of New York! Check my stuff out here (Website hidden by Airbnb) ;) Amazing place! Amazing location, perfect for solo travelers. Would definitely stay again and again. A+++++ thank you! Great location and Nina was very communicative! I\\'m not going to lie, this particularl location is a lot more sketchy than the host lets on in the description. It\\'s fine. It\\'s a fine Airbnb for a few nights stay, and it is in an excellent location. However, it feels unfair to call it a private room due to the situation with the walls (which you should definitely take note of). It feels more like a dorm situation where you can hear everyone around you and they can hear you. To clarify, this was not an unpleasant stay, but you should be prepared to feel a bit uncomfortable for the first night. Overall, not a bad stay, but I probably wouldn\\'t stay again. This was my first stay in an Airbnb apartment and it was excellent! Very affordable, clean, comfortable, and safe. The location was perfect and Nina was always was quick to respond if I had any questions. Exactly as advertised.  Really good location and value for price. DO NOT FALL FOR THE HOST PICTURE. HOST IS NOT A REAL PERSON.\\nHOST IS A MALE. BE AWARE.\\n\\nThe whole experience is shady. From start to finish. Airbnb should verify who the real host is by checking their identification.\\n\\nFirst thing, there is no such person name as Nina, it is a fake picture of some girl and the host is actually a business, not a person. I know it because the owner is Korean male, and the receptionist is Korean male, he just text all the guests pretending that he is a Nina.\\n\\nSecond, when I first booked the room, it did not mention anything about the open ceiling. And the host should have know what \"Private\" means in English. \\n\\nThis is not a room!, this is a 4 cubicles with 4 dividers and they just put a small massage bed and they call it a private room. Look at how lighting from next cubicle shines my cubicle at 2:00AM, you can hear next guy talking to his girlfriend, watching a Youtube video, snoring and just about everything.\\n\\nThird, the air conditioning is so loud, I thought I was sleeping in a warehouse or something. Again, this is not a residential area, host just made a spare business room with the temporary \"Wall\" without ceiling and they call it a \"Private Room\".\\n\\nI will file a credit card chargeback against Airbnb if host do not compensate with full refund of my money. What i expected for the price. location is convenient for amtrak and the port authority. quieter than i expected. Great location. Good communication. Thanks! This room will be smaller than you expect, you will probably hear people snoring throughout the night, you will have difficulties sharing one shower with so many people. The best part of this place is the location and price, but neither offset everything else. Also, Room C does not have electricity as of my departure, so don’t stay there until it’s confirmed to be repaired.  Las  fotos son reales, es muy económico, pero si eres sensible al ruido no descansaras mucho por qué el cuarto hace muchos ruidos internos, siempre suena agua caer, y como las paredes que separan otras camas no llegan al techo siempre escuchas todos los ruidos de todas las personas, tiene una ubicación excelente y por el precio está bien. Host was great. Very responsive. It’s a hit or miss in regards to the neighbors who are going to be staying with you, but can’t really complain because of the price and the perfect location which is exactly what you need in new york city. Nice place to stay in the heart of Manhattan. Perfect communication with Nina before and during my time here. She think even for the noise other guests may make and placed war plugs. Super affordable and perfect for a few nights stay! Very good value, cheap given the location. Nice place, clean and close of everything get what is paid Correct I enjoyed my stay, everything was good \\nThank you\\nFila In the same way of the other comments. Excellent location, easy to arrive and is a little bit better than pictures show. Perfect for travelling alone two/three days and spend your time in this marvellous city\\n Great location, the few minutes from Times Square. Can beat the value. You pay for what you get. You\\'ll have a clean twin size bed with clean Linens, access to a clean bathroom and internet. Comfy place in great location. When it comes to the price, its reasonable in comparison to other NYC properties. Privacy is limited beyond a visual separation of the bedrooms. I can recommend this place though if you look for a place to crash and sleep for a few nights. Organization and communication was done very well, no issues whatsoever. Perfect for a budget stay! Great price for location and accessibility for single travelers! Host was prompt to reply and was sensitive to the guests’ needs. Will definitely stay here again in the future. Affordable and great location. The place was exactly what I needed for a last night stay. Great location, but dont expect anything rather than a bed to sleep at.. I will never stay here. Everything is bad. It honestly is not a bad place. The location was amazing and it’s near foods and Times Square. \\nHowever, it rained very heavily the second day was there. The roof started leaking on the bed. I’m glad I was there when it happened because my suitcase was the first thing to get wet. \\nI wish I could have gotten more of my refund, because I didn’t want to have to wait for someone to fix it while it was still leaking on the bed. I had I get new place which ended up costing me a lot of money. \\n\\nHonestly—it’s a cool place. Exactly what you’d expect. Just be careful it if rains. If you want to stay in a (for NY) cheap room with a great location, this is the room what you should book! Good communicaton, great location. Really small room but you don\\'t need anything special if you just go there to sleep. Totally recommend, thank you. Everything ok. The room was ready one hour before my check in. That was very convenient. \\nLocation is unbeatable. Everything is near.  You get what you pay for. If you just need a space to sleep at night because you will be gone all day. This place is perfect. Even though it is small it worked well for my quick weekend trip. The value for that part of town is great. The place was what was described in the listing. Nothing fancy, but a good place to sleep It’s basic -a cell in a partitioned room - which comes with some minor noise and light issues at night (all of which I expected and was cool with) The location can’t be beat though and therefore the cost is very reasonable. The room was exactly the same as the one shown in the photo. Nice room and environment for short stay. Awesome location. Just the room was a little too cold during the night. Everything else\\'s was good. Easy access to anything Midtown. Tight space but clean. Great location and seems more like a hostel but you have own private space.  I probably would have stayed couple more nights or go back next time. That\\'s a cool place! If you travel alone you have to stay here. Really f@@kin location cause you re on herald Square so you got everything here. It s clean and organized. The room C is like you see by the photos. The rooms are private but you can hear everything by your neighborhood :-) So.. it s good use the ear plugs. Bathroom is warm and with accessories. Shower is comfortable and clean. What can I say more? I was lucky with my neighbors. I stayed for only one night . It was perfect for me because of the location near to time square , Empire State . At night I got a guy the snore really laud and I could here from my room . The rest I’m happy and I recommend if you are looking for a place mostly to sleep with an outstanding location! I had a great time! Thanks! El lugar está muy céntrico, si quieres visitar Manhattan es el lugar ideal Overall, It was a good experience and the location is ideal when visiting the city. Access to the location was easy and it is a suffiicent space if you plan to be gone most of the day. It is a tight space but it did not prove to be an issue. It is in a pretty noisy part of town but it did not bother me too much since it is in the city. Fila is really responsive and helpful. - Great location, easy check in / communication Excellent location in midtown, good enough if you’re meeting places the whole day. It is what they say it is, a family apartment they opened a room for travelers Jennifer was very nice and communicated very well but the problem staying there is the kids I didn’t sleep at all due to the kids playing games while on the phone all night literally from when I checked in at 10pm to 6am the kids was very noisy. My experience was bad and the House has a horrible smell It is exactly what the description says For accommodation in New York City, this was extremely cheap! I would highly recommend if you are only staying there for a night. However, I would not recommend if you cannot sleep through noise or are in town for a long time because there was quite a bit noise (son playing video games) until 2 am and the room was pretty small. The bed was REALLY comfortable though! Great! Cozy, just what you need. Clean and quiet. Great hospitality. Jennifer’s great with communication and makes sure you feel at home! Jennifer is really responsive! The room is basic but good value for the price Close to Long Island RR Just go toward Broadway and walk past Broadway Junction train station Jennifer is a sweet and kind lady. She was very understanding and helped me with directions to her place. Unfortunately once I got there it became a not so good stay. The livingroom/bedroom that they sleep in is right in the front as you come in the door. Its next to the private bedroom. I checked in a little before 10 pm on Friday. There was a kid playing video games literally all night. He was yelling, cursing, screaming, and just generally being loud as he was playing and talking the other people he was playing games with. This went on all night until 7 am Saturday morning. To make it worse, he went to sleep at 7 am but I wasnt able to sleep at that point. Saturday night I stayed up till 11 pm. It was loud till about 1 am with adults. After they went to sleep, here comes the kid again playing video games all night. I managed to go to sleep but was abruptly awaken at 6:16 am by again the kid playing video games and being loud. This is unfortunate because Jennifer is very sweet but this shouldn\\'t be an Airbnb. The room is small but that\\'s manageable. It\\'s the noise that gets the negative review. Also, it\\'s worth mentioning her place is literally a block away from the projects. If you\\'re taking the train, you have to past the projects to get there. Unfortunately, I wouldn\\'t recommend this place. Had a last minute reservation and jennifer was able to accommodate me.  The apartment does have a weird smell. The listing makes note of it being a family apartment and to expect noise which is fine but this was a little excessive. The room is right next to the room the kids were in and they were watching videos for much of the night which I actually didn’t mine for the earlier part of the night but this went on until about 2 am. The room was clean but it was just too much going on here. na Terrible place. Cockroaches in the room, place is dirty, unpleasant smell, all the negative things that you could imagine in a home all in this one very spot. The place is good for one who does not  mind the sound in the early morning or pets. And the place is convenient to catch subways. There is no elevator there, a little unconvinced if you have a large suitcase to carry. Overall the stay was fine. Outstanding value and help from the host. The negative is that the \"private room\" door can\\'t be locked. It\\'s perfect if all you want is a place to crash and to save some money. Nice host The place was ok for 1 night . No issues. Yes some noise will be there Such a nice, kind woman. The room is very comfortable and the bathroom was clean! Habitación muy limitada en Piso muy humilde, muchos niños por todas partes y cucarachas en el suelo The place is just as described on the website. Good place to sleep for a night. nice people. great location  Room was very clean! Bed was nice and comfortable. Host was super nice, loved the flexible check in time. Great place to stay if you’re in the city. Jennifer places was very clean, quite, and comfortable.  I slept very well.  The advertised room picture is very accurate.   It is conveniently located, to stores, and public transportation.  I would definitely stay there, again.    if your looking for a check in and check out  it\\'s okay. The room is lovely. It looks just as the photos online. The bathroom which is not shown was very clean and close to the room. Jennifer and her family are very kind and make you feel very welcome. But please read the description of the apartment carefully because it does state that this is not a quiet apartment. \\n\\nThe location was amazing! There is a grocery store and a deli near by, and the walk to the train station is about 5-7 mins! \\n\\nI really enjoyed my stay in this Airbnb. I would recommend it.  I really enjoyed staying with Jennifer!  If one would like a quiet private room at dorm prices, wether it is for a day or a week, Jennifer’s room is a great stay. The late 7pm entry could be a downer for some. But comfortable bed, free WiFi and clean room, puts one at home right away. Noise annoying kid was up till 7 in morning Nice place Just as expected, the place was private and clean. The apartment itself was a bit hot but the room was kept cool with a fan and the restroom was right next to it. Definitely getting money\\'s worth.  Good place for this price Nice cool room very close to the A&Ac train My stay at Jennifer\\'s place was very nice.  The room is simple and everything was centrally located. A nice place Jennifer\\'s place is close to train station, was sparkling clean and good for the night. I would bring earplugs though due to thin walls. The place is nice and clean. The subway is only 5 min away. Overall good experience. Very clean quiet private and polite. Exactly what I needed after a long trip. No confusion during check in and I was provided with the amenities I needed with a smile. Terrible place!!! First of all this place stinks. I’m not kidding it’s mushy, filthy  and disgusting.  Also, when people said this place is loud, they really meant it! The kid was playing his playstation all night and screaming at other people at the top of his lungs. It came to a point where i left at 4am because I couldn’t take it anymore. I would rather sleep at the airport than staying at this place. Also there is no lock on the door and i felt very unsafe, given this was a very shady apartment. Good spot if you’re traveling on a budget. Close to the J, and C train. Had a great stay As expected, this solution is good only for one night. Closed to the underground, it takes 30 min to reach Manhattan. Jennifer son is quite noisy... The space was very clean, comfortable, and private. There was a bathroom but it was shared with another family who all took showers in the morning so I was unable to freshen up or use the restroom before checking out.  Located very close to the train, and there was a deli nearby. The only issue with my stay was that a young man was up all night yelling, watching movies, being terribly disrespectful to Jennifer for no good reason. Due to this I wasn’t able to get any sleep and wanted to try getting a refund. Not the easiest to get to if you have large and heavy overnight bags because of the stairs. В доме вонь нереальная. Полотенце так сильно воняло, что им не хотелось вытираться. Хозяйка в порядке, общительная, деловая. Квартира в жутком старом доме, комната через комнату хозяйки, очень некомфортно, через стены все слышно. Не рекомендую. Неприятное впечатление. Great homey feel and hospitality! I don\\'t recommend Good value for the price, good for a single night. Jen was welcoming and kind. Very noisy though All good in the room for the price. Quite tidy and clean. Just be cautious of the hosts in terms of asking for extra cash for some random reason - for me, they said i was not responding on Airbnb app after booking and they had to call on my international number to confirm when i was reaching, and the calls were $15. I had to pay this in cash to them apart from the fees that i paid through Airbnb, which was pretty disappointing.\\n\\nAlso, there are kids in the house who have to get ready like around 6-7am so it might get a bit noisy, but that wasn\\'t much of an issue for me. Overall, a decent place to crash for a short night. Exactly as expected. Great place to stay close to the airport. Jennifer was very nice and hospitable. The room was great and I got a good night of sleep. I loved the fact that it was extremely easy to check in. The apartment was great! Paul was very easy to communicate with. The location is fantastic, right by the train a great deal for the price. The place was clean and stylish, and check-in and out was very easy. I will be coming back to stay again and would recommend it to anyone visiting New York! Nice location, subway is very accessible, however to my knowledge, the booking said nothing about other guests, and there were about five other rooms filled with guests and only one bathroom, so there was always a line to use it. Great quiet place. Really tranquil neighborhood. Close to subway station. Great location and space to stay whilst in the city. I didn\\'t meet Paul during my stay but he responded very quickly to my messages and was super helpful answering any questions. Check in was really easy and well explained after booking. The room was as you see in the listing, plus I was able to ask for a clothes railing to hang clothes, comfortable space, perfect for a short trip to the city. The bathroom was clean but often had a bit of a wait as shared between the other rooms in the flat (about 5 or 6)- not a problem if you\\'re not on a tight schedule but something to keep in mind. Location is great and really easy to get to anywhere in the city from. Loved my time here and I would definitely like to come back! Nice stay in a great location. My boyfriend and I really appreciated the quick response time. Our room got very hot the first night, and opening the window didn’t help. We let Paul know and we were quickly helped! It is a shared bathroom, so it could have been cleaner. All-in-all, a great value. Amazing location and really good value! If it wasn\\'t because the check in was a bit confusing and the heater was way too hot, i would have gave five stars. Paul is an extremely helpful host, quick responder and with a great location. Minutes from Central Park, great food and all of the museums you could dream of. We definitely would book again! Really enjoyed my stay in Paul\\'s apartment. The place was right by the train for a quick and easy access to Times Square as well as downtown New York City. There was a desk in the room which was great for doing some work while visiting friends. Will definitely stay again! The house is very nice and well-located. Paul is polite and attentive. I found a mice in the room, the room is just aside the kitchen, there is a pipeline inside the room that makes the weather extremely hot and the 2 fans didn´t make a big difference, the pipeline makes noises all over the night, It was very impossible to sleep for the heat and the noise. The location was perfect, I didn´t meet Paul, there was no towel, no dryer, no cleanning. It wasn´t a nice experience. Is was nice . Great place to stay in a good location. Close to the subway and Central Park. The place was clean and tidy. The room is as you see it in the pictures. Will be starting here again. Great stay with great guest, don’t hesitate to book Great location, very good communication, I recommend this place to visit NYC! Paul’s place is great! Very close to the subway and very convenient. Tons of food places near by would recommend staying with Paul. Good location, a bit noisy because of the cars, good service. nous sommes très déçus.  appartement beaucoup trop cher pour la qualité. 6 chambres dans cet appartement pour une seule salle de bain. Rue bruyante, échaffaudage devant la fenêtre certainement depuis plusieurs années. Odeur de moisi, d\\'urine de renfermé. par contre wifi et machine à café opérationnel\\nà déconseiller Pidan más indicaciones para recoger la llave al menos un día antes de su viaje!!! Location is great in safe neighborhood.  Close to subway line 6. Lots of restaurants,  shops in walking distance. \\nRoom is simple but practical.  Very noisy cuz main traffic road is facing the window.  Bring ear plugs.  Room and room door is next to the stove in the kitchen.  So expect people to wake you up at all times when using the kitchen.  Great to have Keurig coffee machine but useless if you have no coffee k cups.\\nNever met the host. This place is run as a hostel with 6 rooms and no common area,  all share the one bathroom.  Bathroom is totally disgusting.  Don\\'t take a shower unless you have flip flops.  Bring a lot of disinfect lotion. No, I will not stay there again. \\n It was nice staying at Paul‘s for one night! I really liked it that i could do the check in any time! The comunication was very fast and incomplicadet  Wonderful location - just a few blocks from Central Park, safe neighborhood, really close to the subway station. Paul gave great suggestions for things to do in that area and how to get around. Overall the stay was good! Simple, private bedroom with a comfortable bed. The location is unbeatable! Room was very clean. easy contact with host. close to subway. shared bathroom could be a little cleaner, not bad, just not amazing, but To be fair I’m somewhat hard to please when it comes to bathroom cleanliness. Overall I would definitely recommend. El lugar está bueno, pero las indicaciones no son tales y fue complicado conseguir las llaves, ya que no podía contactar al dueño. Appartement calme et bien situé, 2 lignes de métro relativement proches pour aller sur Manhattan ou Brooklyn.\\nLa chambre est partagée avec 3 autres chambres dédiées elles aussi au airbnb.\\nIl est également possible de laisser les bagages le jour de notre départ, ce qui est vraiment super. The rooms are spacious and thanks to the air conditioning and the fans we never got hot. The location ia great since you have 2 subway stations close to the apartment. Central Park is 2 blocks away.\\nThe negative point would be the bathroom which is very very old. Thanksfully despite the other guests we never had to wait or line up to go shower.\\nThe place was quiet and we were not disturbed by the street noise (anyways you’re in New York, expect to hear trafic and a bit of noise!). We slept very well. \\nPaul’s indication were very clear and it was easy to check in.\\nThe girl who cleans and prepares the rooms is very nice! Interesting initial instructions on the location. Overall good experience with a very reasonable price! Would recommend. Paul’s place was the perfect stay in Manhattan, I found it very convenient to get almost everywhere in the city.The space was clean and private and I really appreciated all the information Paul provided before the stay.I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to NYC:)! Great location, but very noisy due to construction. Check in is at a nearby spot, so somewhat inconvenient for our late arrival. Paul runs his Airbnb like a hostel (which is not clear in the listing) with at least 5 bedrooms inside the unit sharing just 1 bathroom. Although Paul is really nice, he cuts major corners on cleanliness. We were there when he flipped our room;  he changed the sheets on our bed but he didn\\'t replace the blanket - all kinds of things clung to it from previous guests and we didn\\'t feel comfortable using it during our extended stay. Everything was dusty and the floors/rug were dirty. The bedroom door didn\\'t actually close (rendering the lock useless) and any of our items could\\'ve been taken at any time. The bathroom, unfortunately, was the worst part. It reeked of waste and was extremely grimy. The state of the shower honestly makes it uncleanable (unless it is replaced) and all the surfaces (especially the floor) were dirty. Be prepared to wait for the bathroom in mornings and evenings. I understand that some things are tough to maintain with so many guests coming and going and we definitely aren\\'t clean freaks... but when the basic stuff (like bed linens and bathroom) are left completely unclean, it doesn\\'t make for a great stay... It was super convenient for our odd and last minute plans! This is a decent place with great connectivity to most of the tourist places. All it takes is around 30 to 45 minutes via metro to reach all major attractions. Room was clean with basic amenities like AC, dresser, decent mattress, dryer etc. Bath room is shared and you may wanna wake up early to get easy access or wake up late. Paul’s place was convenient and close to the subway station. Check in process was easy. Air con was also available in the room which was great. Gut für low budget in new york This is a one bedroom in a 4 bedroom with only one bathroom. A great location. Only a couple blocks to the 6 and q. Fairly quiet and had its own window unit so you could control the air. I recommend this place! El lugar es lo que se ve. Funciona mu bien y vale la pena a por el dinero y comodidad  The apartment has a great location. The other points could be better. At the end it was a good experience. It\\'s really important to read well the mail Paul send you. Easy check in and check out, really great location! Good location in  Manhattan,   while lacking in maintenance and  cleanness in some facilities.  Comfortable,  if it is not overcrowded. Shower was broken and bathroom was dirty. Metro was close. Room was clean and comfortable. Good location, easy to check in and check out. The apartment is in a great location and easy to access. It is for a very affordable price as well, which makes it a good options.\\n\\nWhat was uncomfortable about the stay was the fact the it is very noisy when sleeping in the Blue room by the kitchen, you can hear every cars passing by as well as pedestrians, so it is difficult to sleep. As for the bathroom it is very dirty most of the time and there is a water leak which is wasting a lot of water. Very happy with my stay here.\\nExcellent location - close to everything needed, quick responses to questions and provided with plenty of information before my trip there.\\n\\nThank you! Location was great- but the place seemed a little yucky. Room was satisfactory Great location, close to subway, easy to reach downtown and Central Park. Clean and simple room. Kitchen and bathroom require a renovation. There is only one bathroom for six rooms, you may queue sometimes. La descripción es tal cual, recomendado muy buen ubicación, buena experiencia! I consider this as a pay-for-lesson experience.\\n\\nThe room is right next to the street and we could hear every single bit of noise from the street as if the window was not closed at all. There were car driving by very frequently even at 3 am in the morning on a weekday and we slept poorly when we stayed there.\\n\\nWe contacted the host for the noise issue and asked if he could check anything and he just responded perfunctorily saying New York is always noisy.\\n\\nI understand that the listed price for my stay was cheap in NYC, however, if I knew about the noise issue I would have never booked it in the first place. Todo muy bien, solo pase frío en las mañanas, la pieza era helada.\\n\\nEverything was great! except the cold room in the morning. Brilliant location you pay for what you get. Only down fall is that it gets really hot in the rooms due to steam system  just make sure you switch air con on as soon as you get there.  Would defiantly return and stay here. Just what I expected & announced, no more, no less. Prompt responsiveness.\\nFlexible check-in time.\\nGreat location.\\nSpacious and cozy room. The apartment has a relatively good location in Manhattan, the price is good in relation to New York prices. The room is private, the rest is shared, the shower has a water leak. The apartment is very well located. we could do everything we needed in the surrounding area. This is what made me give 5 stars, because de apartment is very old and two things annoyed me: the bathroom\\'s tap doesn\\'t close completely, so it keeps falling water 24h a day, and the room was always very hot. \\nAs I said, it\\'s still worth it for the price you pay on this very expensive NY area. La relación calidad precio es de lo mejor , no esperes lujos pero si lo necesario para pasar una noche cómoda , está bien comunicado y hay muchas rutas de transporte muy cerca , parada de Bus a solo unos pasos , vecindario muy tranquilo y seguro . An affordable place to crash. Reliable hosts. Bring sheets and towels as the listing indicates.  This place is perfect for my need. If you travel alone, you might find a companion to help you getting around the city. \\nDont expect you get a 5* facilities. If you need just a place to crash at night, this is the one. Couldnt find a place like\\n Atenção a esta hospedagem, fiquei muito frustrado quando encontrei o local \\nNão havia ninguém para recepcionar os clientes.\\nO local estava sujo e fedia por toda parte,\\nA louça permaneceu suja na pia desde o dia que cheguei até o dia que fui embora da hospedagem,\\na infraestrutura oferecida, era precária, a geladeira estava imunda, parecia que não era limpa há meses. Não havia varal para que pudéssemos estender as toalhas ou roupas molhadas. Toalhas essas que não são fornecidas pelo hostel, você deve trazer a sua, assim como travesseiro e suas roupas de cama.\\na segurança do local era mínima, pois quando cheguei a porta ja estava aberta, por isso fiquei com receio que levassem minha coisas, tanto é que o cadeado que levei comigo e tranquei minha mala, depois que eu cheguei na hospedagem, não abriu mais porque acho que tentaram abrir.\\nenfim, foi muito ruim a experiência, para tanto no segundo dia, me mudei para outro hotel, porque não queria ficar mais ali. \\nEnfim por todos esses contratempos e frustrações e por ter gerado em mim uma grande preocupação logo no primeiro dia viagem eu sinalizo pra você que está buscando um lugar pra ficar, que este talvez não seja o ideal pra você.\\nNeste não há segurança, e condições básicas de higiene e limpeza; este local é pra alguém que quer passar 1 noite e já sair no outro dia, tipo, só um lugar pra dormir mesmo e que não espera nenhum luxo.\\nAté as pessoas que lá estavam eram estranhas.\\nEu nunca mais voltarei a este lugar. Much worse than what one can expect! 8 ppl no ac and one toilet! God Bless me! very difficult place to live. Muy bien conectado si llegas al aeropuerto Laguardia , el barrio muy tranquilo y seguro . Muy buena relación calidad precio It is ok if you need sleep somewhere for few days and you don’t want to spend a lot of money. But you don’t want live there for long time :) Thanks you!!\\nGood host!! This place completely exceeded my expectations given its price point. the apartment is immaculately clean it is cheaper than any Airbnb that I have stayed in and much cleaner than most Airbnb that I have stayed in on the lower end of the price Spectrum. Everything went fine! The room itself was pretty clean, but no bed linen, but that wasn’t a problem. It’s good for spending nights there, cause it’s supposed you’re going to be outside. Everything is provided. The area itself is safe and easy to reach by public transport. I recommend that place if you want a place to sleep and plane  you trip. Very close to Laguardia and good connection to the Manhattan. If you are willing to bring your own sleeping bag, it is probably the best price you can pay! Awesome place & people. Creo que precio calidad está bien. Pero podría estar un poco más limpio. a place to stay before my flight next day. exactly as the description. host is friendly. Good for quick sleep.  You need to bring pillow, blanket and amenities as the host mentioned. Cheap and efficient. Melhor relacao custo/beneficio de N.York. The location was good and it was clean Easy and good stay. Excellent place to stay in NYC. There are minor problems though (mainly commhnication issues). However if you put in a tiny bit of effort, host does a really good job at solvong your problems. She is also really caring about the quality of your stay and does her best to ensure your comfort. 9/10. Would definely book again. Sophia and Sergio were great hosts! Sergio kept the place sparkling clean and both of them were very understanding. The apartment location is less than a min from Central Park walking and the area is beautiful and trendy. I very much enjoyed my stay here! Very nice and clean airbnb. Close to subway and town. Sofia and Sergio very helpful. It was very comfortable to stay at Sergio and Sophia, and the communication were really good and on point. It was very clean and good aircondition! It was also really nice that it was two bathrooms. I really recommend these host.  Wonderful place to stay next to a great park to  Great location, great value. Clean and modern. Would definitely book again.  It’s a very nice place and room, with every basic things you need. The location is wonderful, near central Park West and a lot of places to go out and eat. The Subway station os nearby La comunicación con Sofia antes de nuestra llegada siempre fue muy buena, responde muy rápido y está al pendiente de nosotros. Dentro del departamento,  Sergio fue muy amable durante nuestra estancia. Solid spot The place is in a good location on MANHATTAN, that was very important for me, just a block from Central Park. The apartment is clean and maintained, looks like recently was renovated, there are two bathrooms! \\n\\nThe room itself was small but private with AC. \\nIt was pretty noisy sometimes because of the water pipes system in the walls, I recommend taking earplugs for those who cannot sleep with noise. I am among these people actually, but the noise of AC was monotonous and I fell asleep pretty well. \\n\\nOverall, the experience is good, I got what I needed for a great price!\\n Spartanisch, kleines, aber ausreichendes Zimmer.\\nMan sollte sich bewusst sein, dass 4-5 weitere AirBnB-Doppelzimmer in der Wohnung vermietet werden und man eher das Gefühl von einem Hostels hat. Die Bäder wurden leider weder vor noch während des Aufenthalts gesäubert. Zeitnahe Antworten während des Aufenthaltes waren leider vom Host nicht gegeben. \\nDie Wohnung ist verkehrstechnisch gut angebunden. Einkaufsmöglichkeiten sind fussläufig erreichbar und der Central Park ist für Morgenläufe sehr schnell zu erreichen. It was a nice stay and the area is pretty, just right next to the Central Park! We did not meet Sofia and Sergio but communication was easy. There were other airbnb guests but since there were two shared bathroom it was not a problem at all. Thanks for the nice stay! Convenient. Clean. La ubicación es fantástica, a un minuto del central park y muy bien comunicado por metro, bus y bici. El anfitrión entrañable Location is undeniably great, but we overall didn\\'t have a good (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication and information wasn\\'t proactive, there was dirty towels/linens in the common area throughout our stay, the blocked toilet wasn\\'t addressed quickly, there weren\\'t sufficient cooking basics provided like a kettle, and the apartment was stuffy made worse by the burning of incense. Compared to other AirBnB\\'s we\\'ve stayed in and we saw in NYC, we didn\\'t feel Sofia\\'s place offered value for money. Sergio and Sofia were very helpful and very quick to answer queries or requests. Fantastic location for a New York break and excellent value. Would stay again. Recomiendo al 100% este apartamento, el lugar es muy bueno, barrio seguro, cerca al metro, buses y demás. Sergio nos atendió muy bien y el cuarto excelente. Espero volver. Apartment nice and clean in close proximity to central park and the subway. El apartamento está bien ubicado con respecto a los servicios de transporte y lugares de interés turístico. Es acogedor y limpio. El mejor trato y ubicación! The place is clean but basic. Our room had issues with the window and cold air was blowing through two gaps into the room (not exactly ideal as the weather gets colder). Spoke to Sergio about it who promised to do something to rectify the problem.\\n\\nSomething else noteworthy is that there are 4 other rooms in the apartment which are also rented to Airbnb guests and you will be sharing with them. Do yourself a favour and DO NOT BOOK HERE\\nThe only decent thing about this place was its location as it\\'s a block from Central Park (upper west side)\\nI was driving down from Canada, planning to leave at some point throughout the night, Sofia refused to give me the full address and instructions to get in until I gave her an arrival time\\nWhen she did give me the address she mentioned not wanting us to speak to anyone about airbnb as they are not allowed to do short-term rentals in their building\\nI messaged the hosts to ask about whether or not there was an iron for us to use at the apartment, Sofia did not reply until we were already driving down\\nTheir description of their apartment makes it sound as if you are staying in a spare room of their apartment, when really all the other rooms are also rented out to other airbnb guests, making it feel like a hostel rather than an airbnb\\nSharing with all these people also made the bathroom situation difficult as there were two bathrooms but only one of them sort of worked. One bathroom had the toilet sealed off, making it unable to use and the shower head for that same bathroom wouldn\\'t turn on. The other bathroom\\'s tub water stopper would not work properly and the tub almost overflowed multiple times; one of the other guests managed to fix it the first time. Sergio was there when the tub was filling up the first time and did nothing about it. I had messaged the hosts twice about the tub as we needed to shower, the first time I didn\\'t get a response until the next day, the last time Sofia replied AFTER our check out time, even though we ended up leaving to a hotel a day early anyways as we needed a working bathroom and nothing was being done about ours\\nAlso, because the tub kept raising with water and it wasn\\'t cleaned well, residue would rise as well and float around in the tub\\nThe bed linens had also clearly not been washed as there was fairly recent make up and crumbs on them\\nThe room smelt funny when we arrived\\nThe window has gaps in it as well, so the cold October air would get in; there was a thermostat in the bedroom but it didn\\'t work. We were lucky we had brought our own blanket\\nOverall, a bad experience at Sofia and Sergio\\'s place. You could get a lot better apartments in NYC. I would highly not recommend staying here Location is close to the subway and Central Park. Other rooms available if you need more room. Hopefully bathroom issues have now been resolved, I notice a lot of other reviews have mentioned them (toilets and slow draining bath, we also couldn’t get second shower to work). Would be worth topping up soap in the bathroom sink, and maybe providing a kettle for guests to use. Very basic but value for money. Our bedroom was clean. An okay place for anyone just looking for a place to rest their head at night. Be aware, this is more a hostile than a private bedroom. You will be sharing the space with other guests and sharing a community bathroom. If you are looking to just get out and explore all day (which we did) then you can make it work just fine. We did however try to avoid going back until we were sure we would be going to bed. There was also quite a bit of noise at night so if you have troubles with any noise then make sure to take some sleeping aids. Pros:\\n- Great location\\n- Communication upfront was good\\n- Easy checkin and checkout\\n\\nCons:\\n- Very basic room with little comfort (literally only a bed with thin pillows and an unstable bedside table)\\n- Bathrooms were neither cleaned before we arrived nor while we were there - pictures and room description suggested a clean place\\n- Towels were only provided after we’ve asked twice for it late at night\\n- There was a hot water pipe in our room that was extremely noisy in the morning and evening (earplugs highly recommended)\\n- There are two bathrooms that are shared with 3 other bedrooms in the apartment - bathrooms ran also out of soap and toilet paper while we were there\\n\\nOverall we would rather call this place a hostel than an AirBnB as there are quite a few other people in the apartment and the standard in the rooms is quite low compared to similar places we’ve booked before (also in New York). It was a cheap place in a good location and if you don’t mind a dirty bathroom this is your place. We personally would not book again. Good location Great place to stay in the city. Apartment was very clean. Everything we needed was there and loved the small kitchenette. Host was very attentive and accommodated the space for my small children. Would stay there again.  Nice little place. Angelica was an amazing host Pristine space, extremely timely responses and easy check-in, more than enough personal space! Amazing value. Can’t recommend highly enough! Angelica’s place was good, comfortable, quiet place , every amenities is new, clean and near the subway station. I unfortunately didn’t meet her but she host very good response very quick. I will recommend my friend to stay with Angelica’ place Book this place! very close to Subway, kitchen appliances, comfy room!   Amazing experience.  Nice flat, clean and comfy !  Simple and accesible accomodstions. Toilet was clogged and there was rotten food in the fridge. Lindo lugar y muy cómodo, muy buena ubicación y Angélica muy buena anfitrión recomendable alojamiento\\n The apartment was easy to find train station was a block or two anyway and good walking distance !! Appartement très propre idéalement situé a deux pas d\\'une station de métro desservant tout le sud de Manhattan ! \\nAngelica est très réactive aux messages et répond aux attentes ! Je recommande sans hésiter ! \\n\\n This is a great affordable alternative to a hotel in NYC. The room was quiet and comfortable. So glad to have A/C in muggy 90 degree weather. Very accessible by MTA;  30 minutes from Penn Station for example. Would stay here again! Great Harlem location near subway. Clean rooms, kind host! Good price nice place  No el mejor ni muy bueno pero si decente y solo para dormir  Whilst we did not meet Angelica in person, she was a very accommodating host! She responded to all our messages quickly and we were able to drop our bags off before check-in and leave them in the apartment after we had checked-out, ready to pick up later that day. The room is as described with a comfortable bed and everything was clean and tidy. The air-con unit is quite loud but was a welcome addition to the room after a long day in the city! The location is great (5 mins walk to subway and about 15/20mins direct to Times Square). We would definitely stay here again if we are ever back in New York! The privacy was great. Room and apartment was clean. If this place is open, BOOK IT while you can!! The flat could not have been in a better location, and was just as lovely it looks in the photos. She was very accommodating with our check-in schedule, and allowed us to drop off our bags there in the morning after our red-eye flight while we explored Manhattan. Angelica was a  great host. Excellent location for exploring, eating, shopping, and Angelica always available for any questions, routing, or just for a chat. Angelica was an amazing host for my first time to New York. The room was stylish, clean and comfy. The kitchenette had all the essential amenities. The doors were a bit difficult to open the first time, but that was more on my end and Angelica sent a speedy response with video instructions on how to open the doors. She checked up on us which I thought was a nice touch. There is a school across the street, but the only noise I heard was from a tour group and that was only once in four days. Either than that, pretty tame street walking distance to the subway and convenient stores. I would definitely recommend her room... Thank you again Angelica. Le logement proposé par Angelica est bien situé dans Harlem mais je n y serais pas allee seule en tant que jeune femme si je prevoyais de rentrer tard la nuit.\\nIl n est qu à 15 mn de downtown ce qui est tres appreciable. \\nLe logement etait un peu petit a notre goût et en basement ou sous-sol et donnait sur les poubelles. Nous n avons donc pas ouvert les fenetres.\\nC etait agreable d avoir une climatisation meme si extremement bruyante.\\nLa cuisine etait trop petite pour en tout 6 personnes, puisque l autre chambre etait prise par quatre personnes.\\nLes lieux etaient assez propres. \\nCe logement est pratique si vous passez la plupart de votre temps dehors a la decouverte de NYC et si vous aimez partager les lieux avec des inconnus. good Here are a few important details that are missing from them description:\\n\\n(1) Contrary to what the description implies, the host does not seem to actually live in this flat. I assume it\\'s being used for short-term rentals exclusively. During our time there, other renters stayed in the second room and we would share the bathroom and the kitchen with them. The bathroom was not cleaned during that time, so of course hair and other dirt accumulated over time.\\n\\n(2) Below the flat lies a basement in which people living in the house do their laundry. The only way to get to that basement seems to be *through* Angelica\\'s flat. So expect even more strangers walking through the hallway.\\n\\n(3) During our second night, someone was apparently doing some midnight laundry, because around 12:30 a.m., the washing machine started to literally jump around in the basement (defective, not correctly leveled - whatever) making lots of noise. We woke up because of it and texted Angelica, asking her in a very friendly way to take care of this. Her reply she sent the next day was completely unhelpful in that it didn\\'t even touch the issue. Instead, we received the exact same standard sentence we had already seen the other day when we arrived.\\n\\nI can definitely not recommend staying at this flat. Great place to say. Great access to the city. Host was very responsive to communications. Buena llegada al metro y al city bus. Tranquilo. Es amable y para paseos cortos está bien Good place to crash Clean room with comfortable bed. Suited for people just wishing to sleep well during the night and visit the city during the day. We recommend this place! That place just like I expected and it was clean and a nice spot to relax 10 minutes before I was set to check in with Angelica, she sent a  text telling me the place wouldn’t be cleaned until later.  I had all of my bags in tow .. needing a place to change and relax for a little while before my meetings. This put me in a huge bind and winded up having to cancel last minute to look for another Air bnb.  Horrible First experience :-( O local é lindo, você percebe um cuidado com tudo. Todos os cômodos impecáveis, bem limpos, roupas de cama e banho cheirosas, espaço agradável. Ótima localização, muito próximo do metrô mesmo, fácil acesso para Times Square e Wall street, possui mercado e Mc donalds próximo, quanto a segurança o local é tranquilo, chegamos de madrugada e foi bem (Website hidden by Airbnb) certeza me hospedaria novamente sem pensar duas vezes. Ah! Levei meus pais junto e eles adoraram! Great place! This place is cool, clean, and perfect to stay in. It was almost 100 degrees outside while I was there and I couldn’t tell. Everything was immaculate! You could eat off the floors (if you’re into that type of thing) Everything is brand new and I appreciated the TV hook ups with Netflix preloaded. The response was extremely quick and accommodations out of this world. I will definitely stay again. Great place to stay while in NYC! Would recommend it to everyone! We had a great time at Jimmys apartment. It is close to the subway and the A-train drive straight to Manhattan (25-30min). We never met jimmy but he always respond quickly by message or call. We only had one issue with the keypad downstairs. The keypad is broken and you have to ring somebody else ring to get into the building. But a lot of people in the house are awake late at night. Don’t get me wrong, the house is still quite. \\nOverall, it was great and we would come back. Jimmy and his friends were wonderful hosts.  We communicated by text and they were responsive and helpful.  The apartment was just perfect for the four of us;  clean and new, with lots of natural light.  \\n\\nThe neighborhood lacks restaurants and parks, but it\\'s a quick walk to the subway, with trains to Manhattan, other parts of Brooklyn, and Queens. Unterkunft mit kleinen Problemen. The apartment is clean and well located, just a few minutes away from subway. There are a supermarket and some Delis around. We didn\\'t met Jimmy, because of the self-check-in, but he always replied very quick to our e-mails. The apartment is perfekt for a New York trip, we had a very good time there.  Nice modern apartment Jimmy\\'s place was great for our family vacation to NYC. The Metro is a short walk away and gave us access to Manhattan in roughly 30 minutes.  There is one room of bunk beds...and one room with a double bed, kitchen and bathroom. Tv\\'s in both bed rooms. An elevator in the building was nice since the apartment is on the 3rd floor. We basically just used the apartment for sleeping and it met all of our needs. Clean flat, only 10mn walk from Broadway Junction subway station (3 different lines leading to Manhattan in 15/20mn).\\nSome kitchen equipment needs to be added to allow dinner cooking. Everything was great! I’ll start by saying this place exceeded my expectations. I was a little concerned about the neighborhood. It was a bit off putting and I wasn’t sure how safe it would be. I was also concerned about the parking. We arrived close to midnight and the street parking was limited. I messaged the host about parking and couldn’t believe how quickly he responded especially since it was so late. I found parking one block over. I dropped my kids and hubby off at the door and walked back to the apartment alone at night. I was fine and no one bothered me. My car was fine too. This place is really close to the subway  but we decided to Uber everywhere. The ride into Time Square is between $25-$40 depending on the time of day. The place itself is very clean, modern and looks just like the pictures. There are AC units in all the rooms so be sure to look behind the curtains. The towels were nice and fluffy and there was a hair dryer. The street does get a little noisy so if you’re a light sleeper you may want to pack ear plugs. After midnight I don’t remember hearing any noise though. The Netflix TV was so nice especially for winding down and keeping the kids entertained while we got ready to go out. Overall, this place is great! I recommend this place to everyone.  The apartment was a good base if you planned on being out for the majority of the time and not actually spending much time there. It was very bare, there weren’t many utensils in the kitchen if you planned using it to cook meals. There weren’t any hand towels or bath mats provided, and hosts did not respond to messages about this or provide any. The pillows were thin, lumpy and uncomfortable, host did not respond to message about this. For a week stay there weren’t enough towels, however host did supply some more of these quickly upon request. A major issue was the bunk beds in the second room. They were not designed for adults to sleep in. Although the mattresses were very comfortable, the bed frame itself shook and creaked constantly and loudly through the night even at small movements. \\nOverall the home was spacious and clean but needs a few adjustments to be five star. Would stay again if these adjustments were made. Thanks for a great stay First the good:\\nThe place is exactly like the pictures. \\nJimmy answered very quickly\\nIt was OK clean\\nGreat to have TV with Netflix\\nThe place can only be booked for 4 adults and Jimmy didn\\'t mind we also had our two year old (she slept in the bed with us)\\n\\nThe not so good:\\nThe area is not great and it doesn\\'t have good food choices nearby.\\nStreet is noisy, and on the second night there was party at the building behind, although that is not the hosts fault it\\'s worth to mention as it was impossible to sleep (could hear the music loud and clear)\\nThere was no hand towel. Our stay with jimmy was beyond wonderful. The place clean and new remodel. Jimmy was as great host he was quick to respond to our message and made sure we was well situated and have  everything we need for our stay.. thank you for hosting us will definitely stay there again if I am ever in the city. Jimmy’s Place was neat and tidy. Jimmy was a great host, the apartment was very clean and well located. It was 5 min walk from the subway station. I highly recommend staying at his apartment. Thank you Jimmy! The apartment is freshly remodeled, close to  C and L train lines. Very clean appartement and easy check-in. There is also lot of places for parking. Definitely recommended. Communication with Jimmy and Julia was great. They both responded very quick to all my messages. The appartment is exactly what it looks like in the pictures. Check-in was a self check-in and we did not see the hosts, which did not bother us. However the appartment was not cleaned properly before we came, it had had a very quick clean and it was simply dirty in several areas of the appartment. We expressed this to Jimmy who immediately gefundeerd our cleaning fee and promised to send the cleaners again, unfortunately this did not happen. Also look closely to the area of the appartment before you book it. Lovely Space! Looks exactly like the pictures. Close to trains so very public trans friendly. Hosts made check-in and check-out process very smoothly. Definitely would recommend for a stay in Brooklyn. Thanks! Would stay again Nice and clean apartment room Great place, \\nLocation was amazing, \\ncheck in and out was extremely easy \\nwould recommend for anyone looking for a great place to stay in brooklyn \\njimmy was available to answer all inquiries in a timely matter Really nice place just a while for the oven to come on and the plumbing is on the opposite side Really clean apartment and totally recommended it. The price was  excellent m Jimmy is a great communicator, he is also great at attempting to solve any problems you may have. I don\\'t know if it is AirBNB policy but be sure to come prepared to have everything you need, even simple things you don\\'t think of, such as a bottled water or paper towels. Amazing home, small but cozy! Neighborhood is quiet. Clean apartment.  Fast access to the subway, great coffee place nice and close. Make sure to bring towels! The area is not too desirable, but it\\'s a good place to stay with a group. Close to multiple metro stations and comfortable overall. Staying with Alice’s mother, Alexandra, was wonderful! \\nHer apartment is on a corner 1 block away from Central Park, and about 10 minutes walking distance from the nearest metros, so it’s a great location. It’s in upper Manhattan, so you’re not RIGHT next to the main attractions of NYC, but it’s quieter and easy to navigate your way around.\\nAlexandra is a very sweet woman who greeted us on our arrival around 11 am. She generously gave us access to her kitchen, her coffee makers (with really yummy coffee) and offered us a few recommendations to start our trip! \\nShe also has one ADORABLE dog and two cats- so if you have allergies, you might want to be careful, however my girlfriend is allergic to cats and didn’t experience any symptoms. \\nOverall, we loved interacting with Alexandra, and enjoyed our stay at her Airbnb! Would definitely stay again if we’re ever in the city. The room was very clean and the host was very friendly, as were her cats and dog.  It was in a great location next to central park and easy to reach everywhere by bus or subway.  This is a great place to stay in New York. Although it is slightly distant from downtown, it is really close to Central Park and subway stations. The place is a little tight, but it’s good for what you pay compared to other spots in New York. I would definitely recommend staying here because the host was very nice and friendly and gave us tips on great local spots to check out!\\n(This was no problem for me but just an FYI that there are pets- a small dog and a cat.)\\nOverall, it was a good pick.  Private bedroom with AC and a fan, and a comfy bed. Bathroom was right next to the bedroom. Typical NYC apartment with compact spaces and trendy décor. No hassle and very helpful! I would recommend staying here if you are looking for a place on the West-side!   Great location a block from Central Park which was the reason I chose this location. Great communication and responses and would certainly recommend to other guests traveling to New York. A few pros to this place are that the apartment is in a really safe location and it is beautiful, and the pets were the sweetest animals ever. Sadly, the cons outweighed the pros. We were supposed to be given access to the whole apartment, including the kitchen, and free breakfast, and wifi, but instead we were confined to one area with a bedroom and bathroom. The rules made by the host were ridiculous, one of them being that we could not shower past 10 pm and the other being that we could not use the kitchen water and instead had to drink the bathroom sink water. This experience is not what the listing describes it as but it is worth the cheap price of $60. I, personally, would not stay here again. Our hostess was nice and very accommodating. This bedroom in a private apartment is a great value. It\\'s not in the part of town I usually spend time in -- but it\\'s very convenient to the subway. It\\'s a small room--but it\\'s right next to the apartment door, which is right near the building entrance; and the bathroom is immediately next to your room, which enhances privacy. The host is charming and helpful. I chose this place mainly for the value and that\\'s still its outstanding feature. Good location, amenities provided ! What we needed! Appartement très bien situé, proche du métro et de Central Park. Séjour agréable en compagnie d\\'Alexandra et des animaux. A good location very near Central Park but very dusty and cat/ dog hair all over the room. Lots of dust. Good to just crash for the night as it\\'s a very small room and not very clean. We had a little difficulty entering the main building as the host had to leave on an urgent basis. ( waited outside about 15 mins till the next occupant opened the main door). Communication from the host was prompt, WiFi was quite slow.  Very near to Subway Station.... but the cons outweigh the pros... À signaler : présence d’animaux (chien et chats), pas de possibilité d’utiliser la cuisine, hôte travaillant sur place (tranquillité à respecter et horaires pour les douches), 2 ème chambre occupée par d’autres locataires (salle de bain commune)\\n\\nPoints positifs : proche de Central Park, proche de plusieurs lignes de métro, quartier sûr, réactivité aux messages et hôte parlant français/anglais The location is nice. The apartment is a little cluttered because it’s a family home. The room is VERY small, our two carry-ons barely fit between the bed and wall. \\nAnd the house is very cluttered, the entire kitchen was not usable. Additionally, the host is not very friendly person. She scolded me for using the microwave when she was apparently conducting business on the phone in the kitchen on a Saturday morning. She later came and sort of apologized but mainly just told us she has to work on Saturday\\'s. I respect that but felt she could have done that in her room or I recommend that she not have guests in her house.   I feel heating coffee that I ran to dunkin donuts to get was not out of line.  First time I stayed somewhere that didn\\'t offer coffee or have coffee already made.  Bottom line. I felt safe in the neighborhood but not welcomed in this home. Alice’s friend was really nice with me, and helped me with all my requests. The department was clean and really near to Central Park and subway stations. Location is great, safe area. Very small room but right beside the bathroom which made it practical. Barebones room and washroom. Muy cerca y accesible para visitar NY Hello,\\nWe were greeted by Alice\\'s mother, who was always friendly with us.\\nBut the whole house is very dirty and messy, definitely not able to host other people. The room is very small, but okay, the bed is very uncomfortable and I do not know what it has, but it is not a mattress. Despite the good location, I definitely do not recommend it. The Apartment wasn’t really clean. Especially the smell in the bathroom was horrible because of the cat toilet in there. The cat and the dog jumped on the bedsheet all the time. So the bedsheet wasn’t that clean at all. Moreover Iam allergic to cats and with all the hair at the bedsheet I couldn’t sleep there comfortable. I think this is a point should named in the description of the room. I was happy to stay there not longer than one night. \\nThe location nice and easy to finde. We felt save in this area. Communication was easy and Alice mother was really kind. The host canceled this reservation 48 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Me and my friend had an excellent time Yuri\\'s apartment. It was sparkling clean and it served its purpose to provide a place to sleep after long days of exploring Manhattan. The location was conveniently located next to the subway station, so we had an easy time going midtown and lower Manhattan. It\\'s also really close to Central Park, 30 mins walking distance, so it was great. It was also a very safe place. Totally recommend. First night was a bit shaky, but overall it was a comfortable and peaceful stay. Perfect for anyone traveling alone and is just looking for a place to rest up. \\n\\nVery close to the subway for an easy commute to just about anywhere. Also, not a ton of fast food/carry out options. However there are great food stores near  by if you’re in the mood to cook and save a few bucks. :) I most definitely was\\n(even bought a spatula for the house)\\n\\nYari keeps the place very clean, peaceful and comfortable so don’t be rude and make things harder on her.\\n\\nWould definitely book again on a one person trip if she would have me. The apartment was very clean and a great value. Though it is far from central manhattan the apartment is a very close and easy walk to the metro. There is also a bus that picks up and drops off near by that goes to the terminals at LaGuardia airport. The apartment is on the first floor so street noises can be heard at night. There are multiple rooms rented to Airbnb but for the most part there is not interaction with other guests. Overall the stay was great, I would recommend for anyone looking for a basic but clean and comfortable place to sleep in the city. Great stay Yari’s place is the best Hôtesse disponible à toute heure. Nous sommes arrivées très tard et Yari a pu nous aider à nous installer. Le logement est propre, grand et facilement accessible.  Quatre chambres individuelles. \\nLa ligne 1 est située à deux pas de l\\'appartement et mène directement à Time Square. \\nAttention cependant lors des sorties nocturnes. Le quartier m\\'a semblé peu safe aux heures tardives. Idéal pour séjour court. Super convenient being that I travel into the city for work! Very clean and private room and Yari is great with communication and check in/out. Everything was perfect! Overall the experience was ok.  The place was clean.   I liked that there seemed to be cleaning daily.  I did not fully understand that this was a 4 unit space and there was probably 12 people sharing 1 bathroom.  This became a timing issue a time or two. Yari e\\' stata precisissima e velocissima nelle risposte. Sempre raggiungibile. La stanza non male, ma niente di eccezionale, molto basilare (letto semplice con copertina e cuscini). Casa troppo grande, 5 stanze con troppe persone che inevitabilmente provocano non molta pulizia negli spazi comuni e portano rumorosita\\'. Ad ogni modo consigliato per piccole soste (2-3gg massimo). Nice place to say in the city. Excelente anfitriona! La cama y las almohadas son muy cómodas. Limpieza en las habitaciones. Lo necesario para descansar tu hospedaje. I love staying here! Yari is a great host! Yari is a nice host. She\\'s very responsive, too. however, she might want you to pretend you are staying in the apt (as her roommates), since the land lord was not very happy with his/her air bnb business - this was within my expectation If you\\'re into the whole New York vibe right in the middle of Spanish Harlem this is the perfect spot. I felt right at home (city girl.) It was easy to travel (the train was literally across the street.) Oh let me not forget super clean and the restaurant next door had some good Mexican food and wasn\\'t expensive. The room was perfect if you just going to be in the city and need somewhere to sleep. It was enough room for my son and I. Thanxxx Yari. Room was clean but building and neighborhood did not feel that safe. Yari was available when needed and helped me out to find the building. Good location in a decent space. The bathroom situation is way less than ideal; feels like a icky wet public bath house. Could use some small tweaks for a more comforting stay. La ubicación del departamento esta buena ya que es cerca del metro, sin embargo fue extraño que la anfitriona nos indicara cuando llegamos que si alguien nos preguntaba dijéramos que no veníamos por airbnb a hospedarnos...\\nLa limpieza del lugar es buena y cumple con lo básico si quieres solo llegar a dormir y ducharte. Location is great and the hosts are friendly, wonderful people. Would definitely stay with them again! They were so nice! I would love to stay with them, love that part of Brooklyn. Very hospitable and accomodating.. I enjoyed my stay at their apartment. the host is  good Our stay was ok, it could have been better but if u need a cheap bed in NYC it\\'s fine! U will have your own bedroom, which is clean enough. The house is not well rennovated and it was a bit too hot in the bedroom. Though the couple (who\\'ll sleep in het living room during your visit) was very talkative and caring! Thanks!! There is very little information in the listing and it\\'s not accurate. This is only appropriate for 420 friendly guests who don\\'t mind strong smell of weed since the host smokes (the host didn\\'t share this in the listing or in person during check in).  I booked it for my husband and myself and we were forced to leave in the middle of the night due to the strong smell of weed coming from the living room. This is 1bdr apt where host lives with his significant other in the living room and rents a bedroom. There is no real access to kitchen since it\\'s a part of the living room. You will get food container instead of a real fridge. There will be no lock on your room from outside so the room will remain open when you step out. This is not kids friendly. Area is not safe after dark. You can expect a really calm and chill experience.  Down to earth hosts who do not get in your way.  Very hospitable and the place was very clean. Location was ok, a bit overpriced for what you get. Cleanliness has to improve! Bedroom is okay We enjoyed our staying  even though we spend only one night at this apartment. The place is quiet and cozy. Guys were very friendly and helpful! Hope to stay there next time. The building is about 15 mins far from the station of subway and they are nice and helpful. Good spot for the amount you pay. Host was also very flexible with our check in and check out. Lovely place and cozy all transportation near by and stores also food i loves how i was greeted This was a nice and quiet place.  The host was kind and offered just enough amenities for us to feel comfortable for the evening.  The room was spacious.  The location was perfect for attending an event at the Kings Theater right around the corner. they wavy A great host and location this is a nice low key place to get away, a home away from home , I had a great time Great host, very accomodating. Make sure to call to set up a meeting time to transfer keys, etc. Might be a little out of the way if you want to be in the middle of Brooklyn. Otherwise, no issues! Make sure you confirm with him a few days before your reservation. Even if you\\'ve already confirmed with him further in advance. Really knows how to keep a customer happy ! I told him I found a bed bug at witch point he told me to leave his house now and he is a aggressive ass on the phone Overall, a fine stay for one night. It was about a 1 mile walk from the Grant Ave subway station. It wasn’t the nicest area around the station but during the day we never felt unsafe. Check-in was a confusing process and there was no information prior to our arrival. No information about check out either. The apartment was COLD when we first got in, and even though we turned on the heater, it never warmed up past 65. Be aware that the bed only has one sheet and no duvet/comforter to keep you warm at night. There was only one towel and blanket, and no extra pillows for those sleeping on the couch to use. The host was happy to have us. Again, fine for one night but could have been better. Great, welcoming, friendly, and generous host! Clean and very accommodating! Will come back in future. It’s a dope spot. Just need to be really cleaned out and appliances should be plugged and ready to use.. but overall was a nice stay. Very comfortable. Felt welcomed.Clean.\\nMet my expectations. Had such a wonderful time staying at Fabio\\'s place. Easy check-in amazing location. Very clean spacious apartment. Would definitely stay here again. Good place if you want privacy & comfort. Thank you for the great Hospitality! good bedroom really large in a perfect position Fabio has a quiet and clean house. Comfortable and private. Good host and cohost. Safe environment and very clean Warm welcome and cozy They were very nice hosts with a very clean and spacious home. At First glance of my stay they made it impossible to check in and I had to wait for 2-3 hours to accommodate them while I was supposed to be the one accommodated. The place isn’t nearly worth the price. No Heating, No Cable tv in bedroom only living room. Stained pots and pans. No Closet. Also a rush while checking out was a pain to again accommodate the host. Beautiful, minimalist apartment in a lovely part of town. Fabio is an eminently kind and gracious host. I cannot recommend more highly. Amazing! Great location, huge room, super clean and very nice couple hosting. I highly recommend this spot. I booked it last minute not expecting much, but it exceeded my expectations in every way. I would definitely stay again. Nice room in clean appartment. The hosts are very welcoming. Great apartment in brilliant location. Very clean, welcoming and the bedroom is a really good size. Fabio is a very nice, helpful host. Highly recommend. Great place to stay! Great Leona’s place was very clean and looked just like the pictures. Nice safe space in a great location! Communication was very easy and I always heard back within minutes. Highly recommend booking this place. Very nice room in a perfect location. Leona\\'s room was super cute and looked exactly as described. The space was neat, and the location was extremely close to fun restaurants, central park, and public transportation. Would definitely recommend it to anyone coming to visit NYC. 1. The water while taking a shower is extremely irregular. I burned myself twice because the water keeps changing to either extremely hot or extremely cold.\\n2. There is a cleaning fee for the stay, however, the guest is expected to clean their own dishes after use, clean the shower, etc. So why pay the cleaning fee? \\n3. It is extremely hard to enter with the key that is provided. It gets stuck and is hard to open the entrance. I had great time at Leona and Renee’s apartment. They are fantastic hosts, quick response, well-organized and prepared. The room is spacious and super clean. There are many nice restaurants, bars and supermarkets around the neighborhood. The subway is 5 mins by walking. I highly recommend the place to others. I will definitely come back again. Thank you Leone and Renee. Don’t Go !!!!!!!!!! The stuido is nice and clean and the advantage of this stuido is it\\'s close to the main st. Good place for quick stay. Near airport. Zach promptly communicates, and the studio apartment is close to train and subway stations It was as expect. Very nice host. Good for short stay Just what I needed for a weekend food excursion in Flushing! Worth every penny. Taz is an AMAZING host, answers immediately, super nice, awesome person. The place is perfect for someone who just needs a place to sleep. Its clean, has all the basic needs, and its cozy. However, its a bit noisy because its in the first floor, but its better than staying in plain times square! The location is awesome too. A Starbucks a block away, near Hells Kitchen so theres plenty of places to eat, and just a few minutes away from Times Square. Will definitely stay here again if given the chance! Taz was great. He answered my questions via text quickly and was very nice when I misunderstood how his key system worked. Room is large and the location was perfect. 3 minute walk to Times Square and 15 to Rockefeller Center. 10/10 Would book again. I had an emergency and booked his place at the very last minute. He’s very understanding and personally helped me check-in at 10:30pm! Overall, great place, great host and great location! Fantastic location! Taz was very nice and let us stay later then we should have! However, he was very poor at responding the we had to share a key with another renter. An amazingly convenient apartment in an unbeatable location. The bedroom was simple, nice and clean with plenty of room, and Taz was a super attentive host when it came to communicating the logistics. Adoramos a hospitalidade.\\n\\nTodos que nos receberam foram muito gentis.\\n\\nRecomendamos essa casa tudo que precisa está ao alcance.\\n\\nCongratulations.\\n\\nThank so much. Christopher was really kind and cute. Thanks for hosting us! Heisseel’s  place is not good, it’s AMAZING. Starting with her fast response and going beyond to serve any request. The house is beautiful, very very beautiful. It felt like home, she even has a Christmas tree. The house is extremely clean/organized and a variety of utensils. She’s is very kind and her kids too. My boyfriend and I loved our stay and will book again if traveling to NY again. Thank for everything! Super clean, super friendly host! Great value, & very comfortable rooms. Great neighborhood also. Safe & convenient shopping. Very warm and pleasant host. My friend and I had a good time staying at this place. This was a great last minute reservation that worked out PERFECT!! \\nDEETS:\\n\\n*Easy Check-In \\n*Beautiful Decor\\n*Sparkling Clean \\n*Well Scented Home\\n*Great Communication w/ Host\\n*Large Firm & Comfortable Bunk Bed\\n*Desk Set To Store Your Items & Apply Makeup\\n*Extra Chair\\n*Plenty Of Storage Space For Luggage\\n*Easy Parking\\n*Quiet Neighborhood\\nAll this for a REASONABLE PRICE!!

       "'The host canceled this reservation 13 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. The location and the communication with the host were great the only issue I encounter it was the sleeping situation eventhough the host did help me with everything Jack is a great host.  Makes sure you have everything you need from check-in to check-out.  His apartment is in a great midtown location.  I would stay there again. Ok yes. I really like the location of  house and it’s very convenient. And the house is very clean. He is a very nice host. Almost everything is good. The only thing little bother me is just the noise from outside like car or bird something. Anyway Five Stars hahahah I had a nice trip in this place Dirty, unclean, and very outdated/rundown. Apart from location  there is NOTHING nice about this place. I forgot to mention in my review its 4 flights up stairs up no elevator. Thus not suitable for disabled or people who struggle to walk up stairs (esp with luggage).\\n\\nThis place is a very deep clean and for the host to actually clean the place to be respectable by guests. Things like dental floss on the counter, razor with hair in the bathroom, rubbish in the trash can, and cups/clothes, left over takeaway. Very, very disappointing. It worked out cheaper & cleaner to go to a hotel 2 streets away. Space is SHARED, and private room isn\\'t that private. Jack was a great host and his place is perfect location and price for me If you are looking for a place right in the heart of the city, Jack’s place is the perfect fit!  We were walking distance from Time Square, all the way down to Flat Iron District.  Jack is very responsive and overall a great host.  Would definitely stay again. Easy going host. Brilliant locations, no frills but perfect for the price. Well priced place to stay in downtown NYC. Taz as a person and host was great, very friendly, quick to respond to questions, and very knowledgeable about the area.  As a newbie to NY his knowledge was very appreciated. \\n\\nYet here is what I experienced on my 3-day stay. You are sharing the living quarters with other Airbnb guest(s) daily. Be warned because I was woken up several times daily between 12-3am with the other guests coming in and out of the apartment and they have to cross the living room to get to the only bedroom in the apartment. \\n\\nSafety of your valuables and/or luggage is not secure since you are in the living room of a small 1-bedroom apartment with other guests you don’t know. Privacy is very minimal.\\n\\nApartment is on the 4th floor! So if you brought luggage plan on hauling it up and down a narrow set of stairs.\\n\\nOverall, Good deal for the price of a bed in a living room in this area. I recommend renting out the whole place or the bedroom. Unless you are on a tight budget and just need a place to crash for cheap. Taz is Cool! Always prompt and made sure I was set from Check In to Check Out. Quite a nice place. The location is great. Taz responds fastly. There were two beds in one room and another room with a double bed for two. If you are going to be in the city all day long as me and just sleep at the apartment you will love it.. Great location, very clean and the host is always there when we needed. Im very happy for this choice. If I come back to NYC, I want to stay at Taz again! The apartment was very clean and the host was very responsive to messages. Location was perfect, less than 5 minutes walk to the subway and times square . Host is not at all reachable all throughout your stay as he does not lives in new york. Hence expect no commincation over call with him. Be aware that you will be sharing the same room with a stranger, his bed being 1,5 mtr away, and that another stranger will cross your room to go into his room, will probably turn on the ceiling light when he comes, that the bathroom will be as clean as the other guys will let it since Taz doesn\\'t show up, terrible experience for me... beside that the location is ideal The location is in timesquare, which is perfect if you wanna go out early and come home late at night to and from roaming around NYC. The host is awesome, he is very patient to respond to each and every queries I had so my stay will be as smooth as possible. Although, the bulding has no elevator, so if you have a heavy luggages, you have to carry them through the stairs. Otherwise, everything was good. This was my first time staying in a shared apartment and it ended up being a great experience. Excellent location, exactly what i needed for only being at the room to shower/sleep. Apartment was quiet and other guests respectful. Would definitely recommend as it is much more affordable than anything else around the city. Taz was extremely responsive and gave me perfect logistics advice for free parking quick public transportation to the apartment. Very affordable place right next to Times Square. Excellent if you just need to crash for a night or two with the bare minimum. You get what you pay for. No lock for your valuables FYI. Centrally located, Good place if you are looking for a shared space in heart of manhattan. Taz was very nice and responsive. The place is extremely well situated, which makes its interest. Yet, it is very small and we were 4 people in there (all unknown to each other). The beds weren\\'t ready when I arrived (around 5pm), and above all, the place was dirty (the bathroom in particular was extremely dirty). So I recommend it if you have no other choice, but I stayed one night and wouldn\\'t want to stay another one in such an unclean environment. Needs to be more accurate with description The place is very good location.You can trip by walking the Times Square and the house very nice great location  What a truly horrible experience This was an absolutely terrible experience. Do not stay here. The location of the apartment is very convenient. However, the bathroom was absolutely disgusting with hair and urine all over the place as soon as I arrived. The host added another bed to the living room. You already have little to no privacy, which is something I was ready to deal with. However, with the additional bed you might as well be staying in a hostel. Very misleading representation of the unit.  El alojamiento de Taz tiene una excelente ubicación y comodidades básicas para una estadía corta a muy buen precio. La coordinación para la llegada y la salida fue muy buena y Taz siempre respondió con rapidez mis consultas. This place is prime if you are looking for an inexpensive place to crash right in the heart of everything. I was in New York for a night due to some flight cancellations and just needed a place for an evening while taking in some shows. Taz was great with communication and it was easy to get in. It is a fourth floor walk up so just keep that in mind if you do have a lot of luggage. Just know that you are sharing space with others but it wasn’t a big deal for the short time that I was there. Don’t know that I would stay here for a long period of time but it was perfect for the time that I was there. I would fully recommend this to anybody who’s looking for an inexpensive place to stay right in the heart of Hells kitchen. I felt completely safe and was not worried about any of my belongings. It’s a multi-bed apartment Great location and price! It’s a bunch of stairs only to be disappointed \\nWorst experience, dirty sheets, unresponsive host\\nI didn’t even stay, I left almost immediately  It was a quick stay. I was in the apartment only for one night, but everything went fine. Communication was fast and efficient. A good place to stay in NYC if you are travelling alone. Fair price for a place near Times Square. Great experience. Convient.  You should not book this place for more than a night. The location is great and so is the hosts willingness to communicate. The praise stops there. The place is disgusting. It is unsanitary. When I arrived I noticed that the sheets were dirty. It had hair follicles all over the sheets. Then there was dust all over the house. Then there’s the towels. Tax’s towels are disgusting. It looks as if he throws the towels in the closet and never washes them. It had stains on them and smelled absolutely disgusting. Beware that this place is not as seen. the room was ok, the toilet dirty, location good Amazing location conforme a la description, confortable, connexion internet et excellente localisation et le propriétaire est réactif aux messages\\n I arrive at 7 am. I steady spoken to the host about being in later and asked if I could extend my stay half day. No response. I arrive in the unit and the sheets are dirty with hair bugs and stains. I kept calling to get clarity on clean sheets and towel. The other people staying in unit also had a hard time with cleanliness but didn’t speak English very well. Finally Taz calls me and is saying allow a cleaning guy to change sheets in 1 hour. I sleep by 8:30 am. I wake up at 2:30 pm to someone yelling at me from within. He kept saying “You need to leave.” Very rude and kept pressuring me. When I asked about a clean towel he rudely says “This isn’t a hotel!” Okay... so I call Taz again and he asks to speak to this Cleaning guy and tells me please let him change the bed for next person. He finally does and leaves. Taz texts me saying I could take a shower and stay —- just after he said “You need to leave.” I take a shower and dried off with paper towels.... the shower has not been cleaned there’s a big hunk of hair and dirt. I noticed before leaving the “cleaning guy” left my dirty sheets on the bed and used same DIRTY blanket with bugs. Taz claimed the sheets were cleaned. See pictures.  Great service and place.  will get the job done for a night Good quick little stay. Zero problems.  incredible Je déconseille fortement ce logement. A l’arrivée j’ai trouvé des draps sales, un lit non fait, une salle de bain sale.\\nL’hôte n’a pas mis toutes les informations.\\nUne personne est passée pour faire le ménage mais ça s’est juste limité à changer les draps.  Blah Taz is a very helpful, responsive host. The value of the stay is decent too. One of the cheapest places on Manhattan Taz was an excellent host! He asked and helped me how to get there! It was an excellent place to stay! Hi! The accommodation is perfectly located for a traveller. You can have breakfast, lunch, dinner at only 5min walk away. The space is really small, but if you choose to rent it only for the bed and the bathroom, the price is the best you can get in this area. Best location if your looking to stay in Time Square, any hotel will run you $200+ easily. I’m pretty easy going but this is still a service you pay for. The bed was not made when I arrived. I informed the host and they had someone come to the apartment, I then was instructed to go to the closet and get the sheets and make the bed myself. The bathroom is also not the cleanest and has mold in the tub plus missing tiles. Perfect location to crash for a night while exploring NY Excellent location, next to Time square.

The location was nice! Very close to Time Square. However, I would say you get what you pay. Everything was nice and without any troubles. Location is perfect It was hard to find the keys, no instruction, no air conditioner. Si planeas estar fuera y solo buscas lugar para dormir y bañarte... Este es el lugar perfecto. Buena ubicación y precio. Taz was great. Everything was clean and organized. He was there when I needed him for assistance. I was a little nervous to find the lockbox because I arrived late, but it wasn’t as bad as I thought. It was actually really easy. There’s also security( a camera that watches the front door), which made me feel a little bit safer considering I was traveling alone and staying with complete strangers. Location was great—smack dab in the middle of everything but also kind of secluded. The only problem I had was the other guest, but it is what it is. I was only in town for 12 hours. Just needed a bed for the night, but the time I spend in the room was fine. Blanket, sheets, and towel seemed clean and were neatly folded when I arrived. Place overall seemed clean. Nothing bad to say over here. As mentioned in the description: there are two beds in one room, just separated by a folding screen. The neighbours i had were rather silent. However the room is also the corridor in a second room (withe double bed), and therefore people living there walk by the bed. Wearing shoes this is noisy and dirty. The bathroom is shared by all four people. Muy bueno el lugar para el que quiera recorrer NY, la estación de colectivos y trenes está a la vuelta, te permite llegar al aeropuerto, a los buses, a los subtes, con mucha facilidad para recorrer económicamente NY. A 2 cuadras de time square, todo cerca. No tiene muchas comodidades pero no se necesita más para quien busca dormir y bañarse. Muy buena la atención de taz Taz was very reliable and he responds rapidly. Location was PERFECT.  Will definitely be staying again Great location and smooth process Taz\\'s place was great! Quick and convenient, thank you so much. Good Good place for a short stay Fast communication Do yourself a favor and get and airbnb somewhere else. I felt like I was experiencing what NY used to be like back in the day. On cold nights, not having a heater will make you sleep with both your sweater and a coat, since the blankets are pretty thin. The big lock you get your keys from at the check in might get stuck in the rain. I picked this place, because it said washer and dryer are (in-unit). They are in the basement (this apt. is on the 4th floor w no elevator), and you have to call Taz to let you in. It will not be convenient. I ended up washing my clothes by hand and drying them on the room divider screen by the bed. I wasn\\'t very happy to be doing that. There is no place to put your clothes or anything by the way, not even a coat rack or a drawer. Also, the light weight screen keeps collapsing. The other guest\\'s bed and the screen are right next to you screen, so the guests that stayed in the other bed also had their screen collapsing over my screen. When the screen is open a little wider to just get into your bed or to prevent the screen from collapsing all the time, it gets difficult for the people staying in the room to get through. In the tiny livingroom, there really are two beds, two screens, two lamps, and nothing else. No place to store anything. It didn\\'t exactly feel homey. \\n\\nThe host gave me one towel for all 5 nights of stay. I think the girls staying in the room asked for more towels, and they didn\\'t get more. When they really asked for a heater and they got a small heater, even my livingroom bed was warmer, and I didn\\'t have to sleep with both my sweater and coat on underneath the thin blanket....The kitchen was missing a paper towel (that I wanted to dry your hands after washing your hands, since the bathroom is sometimes shared between 4 ppl) for liek the first 3 nights of my stay. I think he came into the apt. to set up the bed and to take out the trash, but I don\\'t think he was really cleaning anything. The bathroom has mold, and the whole apt. seemed a bit dusty. \\n\\nI had booked an additional night of stay a week in advance via airbnb, but I don\\'t think the host checked my message in time or looked at the guest list thoroughly. He asked me (he did ask me nicely) when I was going to check out on my 2nd to the last day, which made me panic a little, thinking that maybe I didn\\'t have a place to stay that night. That was when I was in the middle of touring Brooklyn. I was stressed. \\n\\nI hope the host will provide some storage place for guest\\'s clothes, at the very least. I think this place is at a good location (although there are other airbnbs in this location) if you are watching shows, but I think the host can put a little more effort to making the place feel like home. Or at the very least, making the place feel comfortable. I really have never stayed at an Airbnb where I had to hang my clothes over the cheapest room divider screens. There are slightly heavier screens for a little more money. Especially with the screens by both my bed and the other guest\\'s bed constantly falling, I did not enjoy that experience of having to hang or dry my clothes (that I have washed by hand) over the screen. \\n\\nSince there are other airbnb postings at similar prices with elevators or cleaner apt or apt with some way of hanging or storing your clothes/stuff, I would like to recommend finding and airbnb elsewhere until this place gets to be a little more like a home people would actually live in. Excellent  location. I had to pay 220 dlls for a night in a hotel because taz could not receive me at the time we had agreed. great place. highly recommend. close to time square and the metro system to get u anywhere u need. Taz was a great host with a great place! He answered many of my questions before I booked and was always very fast with responding. The location is PERFECT with being only 2 blocks from time square. The place was clean and stocked with basics such as towels, soaps, cups, etc. Highly recommend. We will definitely be back to stay again!! Clean space in a central location; 5 min walk to bus terminal, Broadway, and great restaurants in Hell’s Kitchen. Taz responded very promptly and met me at the apartment at my convenience to give me the keys.  I took off a star only because you have to walk through another bedroom to get to your room which was awkward in the morning and because the heat and A/C weren’t running yet so I was a bit cold. But I was very happy and would definitely come back! He apartment is simple but good. It is next to Times Square and half way to Central Park! Taz was really helpful and kind, that is why I recommend this place! Taz is very attentive to my concerns and responded quickly to my calls. I stayed there for 3 nights but there were 4 different male guests stayed in the open small living area each night. I had to walk across the living area to access bathroom and to exit door. As a single female traveler, I don’t think is safe and provide good privacy. Great host. Prompt in responding. Good hospitality. Excellent location. Overall, loved the place and had a great stay :)\\nHighly recommend to anyone who is looking for a place for temporary stay close to Times Square. This place is perfect, location is great, it was very clean and was kept clean during my staying. There is a private room and then two beds in the living room. \\nThe room is not big but you can have your luggage inside wit oh out any problem (not too much luggage though)\\nThe host was kind and open to answer any question always.\\nI will definitely recommend this place! My friend and I had to book with Taz very last minute, as we had a different airbnb booked and it turned out to NOT be what we thought it was. Taz was absolutely amazing and empathetic to us! A very safe place (my friend and I are 21 year old women) and minutes from Times Square and a great nightlife. Bed was super comfortable; we wish we would’ve booked with him our entire trip! Do not hesitate to stay with Taz! La habitación es como se muestra en la imagen, es ideal para estar un par de días en NY, el departamento tiene lo que necesitas, cocina y baño compartido, muy limpio todo y ordenado. Taz es muy agradable y estuvo al pendiente de nuestra llegada. Recomendable 100 % Taz\\'s place is at a great location close to time square and an amazing value for money. He was super responsive and flexible making the whole stay effortless. Taz\\'s private room was fine.  The place did not have any common area as that was partitioned for other guests with screens.  If you are just gonna sleep there it is perfect Taz was really flexible & helpful with our last minute booking. The City never sleeps but i slept very well :-) Too many ants everywhere \\nToo small space \\nBroken blinds/curtains\\nDirty Bathroom Room was as advertised. Right off Times Square There are a lot of fur of human and we can’t sleep well in this house, and so does bathroom.\\nTowel is so dirty that we couldn’t use.\\nHost sent us a message that gives information about house key.\\nBut in the key box, there is noooo key. We waited a lot of time in the night. And we felt scared. Therefore, we ask of someone for our situation and we can enter the building.\\nBut! There are another guests in there. This house is sharing room.\\nHost didn’t notice about that.\\nEven, It was the opposite sex. \\nSo we slept with man and woman.\\nAnd he lived in India. We couldn’t keep in touch.\\nAfter this bad situation, host answered our messages quickly and apologize.  Had an excellent stay!! Highly recommend. You pay a lower price compared to other options in that area. It is a simple and old place that accommodates reasonably in the bedroom one couple. I stayed there one night and it was ok. Location is the positive thing, but you need to close your eyes to cleaning in bathroom. When circulating in the common areas you should also accept other people sleeping in the two single beds installed in the living room.  Except for initial hiccup of the room not being ready during my check-in time, rest was fine. The location is very good and if you\\'re looking for a short trip and just a place to sleep at night, this place can do. Taz seemed like a decent host. Unfortunately the other guests who’d rented the place were disrespectful and made the experience unpleasant. This was a great location for a great price. I stayed in the back bed room that was uner lock and key. It was small but perfect if you just need a place to sleep, bath and dress. It was not clear how much there was a lack of privacy for those staying in the living room. For my partner and I staying in the back bed room we had to awkwardly walk through the living room where two other guest were staying every time we came into the apartment, every time we went to the bathroom or needed to use the kitchen. It made it very awkward and uncomfortable for all guests. But I suppose the guest in the living room knew what they were signing up for when they reserved the living room. However, it seemed some guest didn\\'t realize they would be sharing the space. Overall the place was clean, we stayed three days and only got one towel so that made the linen situation a little difficult. The bed was comfortable and the air-conditioner was great! The bathroom stayed clean when the cleaning crew came to set up for other guest in the living room. The host worked with me and allowed me to check in my luggage early and usually responded quickly. He said he had an iron but I was not able to ever find it. The location is amazing and I feel like I got what I paid for. This was an amazing experience.  Was hesitant at first but I definitely would do it again. Our roommates were very friendly.   The bed and pillows were top of the line.  Very comfortable.   The best thing was the location.  We couldn\\'t ask for anything better. Taz is the Best! Thank you.  We will be back soon. ☺️ Even if the apartment is very well-located, the bathroom was not clean enough. Besides, even if the bed is pretty good, it is quite uncomfortable in general since there are two other beds in the main room that we have to get through to get into the bedroom.\\nIn conclusion, the bedroom could have been ok for one night if the price was lower. Excellent place The location of the place is perfect!  In heart of Manhattan and just a block away from time square. All you had to do was get out of the building for perfect NYC experience.  Great location of aptm, in a few minutes you stride the sidewalks of Times Square. We mostly walked about the city but subway stations are near. We were lucky to meet a cool roommates but in case there was a j*rk it would be hard to go along. The room is not spacious enough for 4 people in case you want to cook. The price fits the location. From the appliances all works well except the range which is aggravatingly slow. Taz’s reaction were always fast and accurate. \\nFrom me 4/5, minus point for cleanness of towels and bedding. It’s a good place, near Time square and Central park. Thanks one more time. The bed had same sheets previous guest used. There was hairs in the bed and bed was not made when I checked in. I had to buy sheet to sleep and used tshirt over the pillows. The towels in bathroom also seemed dirty and already used. The location is great. Easy check in. Verejne hodnotenie je dobré Nice and smooth..great location + \\nGreat location right next to Times Square \\nClear check-in instructions \\nEasy communication with host \\n\\n-\\nInsects!! Ants all over the place, woke up in the morning with several of them on my arms and legs. The floor and the window were full of ants as well. We had to check all our clothes and things  in the morning and leave ASAP.\\nNo linen. Literally nothing. \\nNo towels. \\nThe place was extremely dirty. \\n Nice and clean place, extremely well located! I cannot rate the appartment itself  because we arrived and were not able to enter because of the missing key in the box in front of the flat. Taz was Not reachable either by phone nor by message. Unfortunately a disappointed Trip to NYC.  Great location!  Muy buen trato I did not have a great experience at Taz’s place. First I did not feel safe in the neighborhood, some homeless people, drugged people, came into the building while I was there. Second, I shared the room/apartment with a stranger, I did not expect that. Third, no towel, no soap, nothing to shower. Fourth, the tube was disgusting, with broken tiles and mold. With the pictures, it is hidden, you can not see it. Fifth, no elevator (3or 4th floor) with big luggages. Not fun. Sixth, you have a powerpoint to find the key. So inexistant check-in. I arrived at 2am and Taz did not replied immediately to me, even if he knew my arrival time. Seventh, the price is really expensive for what you get. So, now you are aware. I would not recommend it how it is.\\nJe ne recommande pas cet endroit, pour le prix vous pouvez avoir mieux dans le quartier. Taz was an amazing host. Easy to communicate with. The place was clean and nice. We had our own cozy bedroom. Great location, check-in and check out very good.  If location is most important to you and you don’t plan to be in the room at all, then this place is okay. It is not very clean though, just an old building that likely couldn’t really feel clean even if you just cleaned it. I just felt I needed to shower after leaving the place and I didn’t really want to shower there. But again if Times Square location is priority, this will do the job.  Amazing place and quick self-check in. Highly recommended  Very bad experience! Never again the worst place very dirty ! Uhhhhh never again!  Taz was amazing at responding to our request and getting us sorted after our previous accommodation fell through - and was consistently quick at responding. The location is amazing too, couldn’t be much closer to Times Square. It isn’t the cleanest place but I didn’t expect it to be and we weren’t too fussed anyway. Total disappointment! \\nwhen I got there, there was no key to check in. So I had to carry my laptops with myself for the entire night. Around 9 PM, the other guests checked out, so I was able to obtain the key to leave my stuff there. Then early in the morning, someone rang the bell, for a few minutes, for multiple times! I imagine eventually the other guest in the living room solved the problem by opening the door for a new guest. \\nThe linen was not washed,  and there was the hair of the previous guests on the pillow.\\nI have stayed in Manhattan, multiple times. This place has been my worst experience up to now. This is okay. Was not exactly as I Expected. Esta ubicado en un lugar con gran acceso a metro y puntos claves de nueva york Pretty good stay for the price point! Only problem was the kitchen was kinda dirty and the bathroom looked really gross, wanted to wear my shoes while talking a show or using the bathroom in general. @ Only a tiny bedroom that is a jungle of dividers and bodies to get too. I would suggest a hotel app and staying at any of the major hotels around broadway for <$120 Taz is nice and responsive and the location is close to Time Square. However, I cannot recommend the place. The apartment was dirty: the bed was made with used linen full of previous guests hair (Taz changed it after we complained), the floor was sticky and dirty, the bathroom has mold on the wall and has missing tiles, there were bugs in the room and some weird odor, the room s tiny - furnished with only a bed, a wall mirror and nothing else.  We were there for 3 nights and felt gross the whole time. Not only that, the apartment is on  4th floor, with dingy stair cases, and no elevator. For $120/night, you can get much better and cleaner places in the area. Location was good. Apartment wasn’t clean. Location is decent, however the whole apartment is very un-clean. Unless you are in a pinch, I wouldn’t recommend staying here. The whole place is very un-inviting. There was hair all over my linens and the bathroom was grotesque. Taz’s communication was excellent. Booked the private room 2 weeks in advance, and was on point during the stay. Easy and fast response. \\n\\nThe lock box for the key is nearby to the apartment. Not the easiest thing to figure out to open, but it’s manageable. \\n\\nI booked the private room, and it was excellent. A queen sized bed. The A/C works. Clean bead sheets and towels. Plug is next to the bed. Door for privacy. \\n\\nThe common area has two twin sized beds on opposite sides with dividers separating them apart. There were two guests during my stay, but with my private room, it was fine. \\n\\nThe kitchen was clean with a big/normal sized refrigerator if you need the space (I didn’t need to use it). \\n\\nThe bathroom was fine. The sink and toilet were clean. The bathtub was clean, but it’s needs some tlc to replace the old tiles that are moldy on the corners. \\n\\nOverall for the $120-$140 price range near Times Square, it’s fine. I only stayed for one night (checked in at 9pm, checked out at 6am). WiFi is fast \\n\\nI got my money’s worth for the stay with the private room. Great location It was a confortable place to stay . Very near from everything. Good location. Ubicación excelente! I will \"not\" recommend this place to anyone, not now, not ever!.  \\n\\nHere are the facts:\\nThe information provided by the owner was very misleading and led me to believe I will be having privacy, but in reality, there is zero privacy.\\n\\nUpon our arrival, we found a total stranger staying in the living room, only separated by a screen surrounding his bed, full of see-through gaps that allow him/her to look at us.  There were clothes, from this total stranger, being hung over the screens and over a lamp at the entrance of the so-called “private room”.  Remember, you are in the middle of Manhattan.\\n\\nIf you needed to use the restroom, you need to walk across the living room, where strangers were being allowed to stay with you.  The accommodation for each stranger was a screen full of see-through gaps where they could easily look at you as you walk through the living room to get to the bathroom, or back.\\n\\nYou need to share only one bathroom, which already look disgusting, with strangers who will also be sleeping next to you. \\n\\nThe bed’s covers looked dirty, used, and with stain when we arrived.  I did not even dared to sit on this bed, as it looked disgusting. \\n\\nI felt unsafe, threaten, and totally unprotected.  Please keep in mind we are talking of the middle of Manhattan, NY.  Imagine yourself sleeping with two complete strangers (each separated only by a screen) where there is no privacy.  In addition to this, these strangers can see through the screen and look at you every time you needed to use the bathroom or simply, just walk through the living room.  Remember you needed to share the bathroom with them.\\n\\nWhen I called the owner the first time, only for a second, he seemed cooperative.  He asked me to wait, that he will call me back.  The second time he call, he was very uncooperative.  \\n\\nI would never ever recommend this place to anyone.  In fact, I just turned around and decided to go to a hotel.  It was not worthy, not even for all the money in the world, to put my life or my heath at risk! Appartement très bien situé, en plein Times square. Idéal pour visiter New York. Amazing host! Very good communication.. The place is very Central and very clean! Highly recommended Best host ! Thank you for your help ! Nice place Walking distance to time square. Quick check in and response. Overall great place to stay! Great space for being in the City! Right by Times Square. Very clean and perfect for a few nights stay! Taz is chill and very friendly! Great stay! great. While Taz came across as a generally friendly person, we were quite surprised by the overall state of the apartment. Having travelled a long distance to spend the night in New York City we entered to find our bedroom sheets filled with hair and markings- a clear indication that the room was not cleaned after the last person used it. In addition to this, Taz showed up at the apartment to give us our keys an hour later than our agreed time. Unfortunately we decided to not spend the night in his apartment because we also could not lock our room door and didn\\'t feel comfortable leaving our possessions out in the open (we shared the apartment with two other guests). Even though we already paid for the apartment, we simply couldn\\'t sleep on used sheets. \\nIn addition to this, I would recommend that Taz provides his guests with a locker space to safely store their belongings. I would also urge Taz to make sure that his guests feel comfortable during their stay in NYC by providing a safe and clean environment for his guests. La habitación es pequeña pero la\\nUbicación es inmejorable, está cerca de todo, llegamos desde el\\nAeropuerto en metro y fue muy sencillo, el baño es muy limpio y cuenta con todas las amenidades. Worked out perfectly. Madison was prompted with answers to questions and patient with my en experience to airbnb. The place is private and located nicely in Manhattan. I was concerned because I forgot to pack towls.there was brand new ones to use in the linen closet.agsin worked out perfectly. His hours of check in and out were absolutely flexible and fit my needs perfectly. Good localization, quiet room, safe area, regular clean.  This was the first time I used AirBnB as I always use hotels.  The experience was different but not in bad way.  One has to be bit more self sufficient as there is nobody waiting for your every request like a hotel.  Madison was very responsive to my questions and had good instructions on usage of the apt.  The neighborhood and apt was safe and the stay was good.   A parte il fraintendimento avvenuto tutto è stato ok camera nella norma bagno nella norma il vero punto di forza è la posizione centralissima che ti permette d arrivare a time square in dieci minuti d cammino il prezzo per la zona è  abbordabile \\r\\nMadison è  una persona molto cordiale \\r\\nConsiglio a tutti coloro che fanno una toccata e fuga e che un po si adattano di alloggiare da Madison\\r\\nLa descrizione dell\\'appartamento è corretta I had a great  stay. The location is perfect. The room has everything you need and the common rooms were  clean. The process  was quick and easy. Madison was very helpful and answered quickly. Madison\\'s apt. was conveniently located near Times Square and we were able to get to all our spots with relative ease.  His place, however, is essentially like a hostel and thus the noise and cleanliness is dependent on the others who are staying with you. Each room has its own lock so you don\\'t need to worry about your stuff. The beds were very high up and if youre cloister phobic may cause you problems. All in all I\\'d recommend this location to anyone who is looking for a confident locale and is ok with a hostely feel. Madison was nice and helpful. The only real complaints is it can be a little dirty and you have to walk up five flights to get to his apt. The listing description was pretty accurate. The room is essentially enough just for one person (for 2 people it is not enough).\\r\\nThe room was dirty ( we cleaned the air-condition filter ourselves since it started making very strange noises  and found 1 cm layer of dirt, there was some hair on the bed and the floor was dirty also).\\r\\nThe couch is not made for sleeping even tough it turns into a bed.\\r\\nThe location is great and so was Madison. He was very responsive and helped us in any way he could. Listing was as listed.  Getting into the place was a little tricky but my daughter and I treated it as a little scavenger hunt.  The room is very small but one would expect that in Manhattan.  Bring all your toiletries because none are provided.  I couldn\\'t get the TV to work but I didn\\'t try that hard either.  Location is listed as Times Square - it\\'s roughly a 15 minute walk to the main areas of Times Square.  All in all it was a decent experience.   I did not meet Madison but he is very responsive.   It was good. For your first time in New York it was perfectly located (10 minutes from Times Square or the Empire State Bulding). Everything you need is in the room. I recommand this place for someone who is used to hostels. I loved this place. The apartment has everything that you need. Good location. Madison was very helpful. He answered every questions very quickly. Easy stay in New York - plane was 4 hours late, but finding key was easy even after midnight. Room was tiny for 2 but sufficient for sleepover - 4 floors up with heavy luggage & no lift (as I expected), Air Conditioning worked fine, which was needed that night, WiFi, public room fine for the little we used it & didn\\'t cook. \\r\\nIn the end, did what we set out to do - walked a few blocks over to Times Square with daughter (only at 3:30am !!!) & met up with the afterparty pizza/diner crowd, and slept til 11am to check out & walk over to Penn Station for JFK.  \\r\\n(note: Schwartz luggage drop for Manhattan is 1 block away from the flat - nothing in Penn Station if you don\\'t have Amtrak tickets, can also arrange airport transport from Schwartz, but we used A line express) The flat is well located near times square and penn station. Madison answers quickly. It\\'s very easy to find the box for the Key even if it was not inside and we had to call Madison (somebody was \"cleaning\" the room...).\\n\\nThe room was quite clean but the bed is definitely too small for 2 persons and the couch is not confortable so it\\'s impossible to sleep on it. \\nThe kitchen seemed ok and clean. (didn\\'t use it). The bathroom was dirty.\\n\\nTo conclude, this room is fine for one person who is used to living with roommates or in hostels. Had a great stay at Madison\\'s apartment. It was clean and in a safe neighborhood. It\\'s close to everything - highly recommended. The location is perfect. The rooms are good and fit for two The location of the apartament is great, Madsion replies very quickly to questions, the neigbourhood was friendly and the streets were crowded even during late hours. Each room can be locked seperately, which was very good. The apartmant was very quite as well. Rooms are pretty small, the bathrooms were not as clean as they could have been during our stay.\\r\\n The apartment is old but clean. There is no host around, all the rooms are being rented out separately and living room/kitchen/bathrooms are shared with other guests. Room is small but well organized with a bunk bed. Wouldn\\'t recommend it for tall people though as the bed is quite short. No street noise but you can hear neighbor\\'s dog barking and people coming in and out. Didn\\'t use the common area but everything seemed OK there. Bathrooms were reasonably clean. Surrounding area is quiet, restaurants and grocery store nearby.\\r\\n\\r\\nI received very detailed and clear instructions about where to find the key to the building. The only problem was that when I arrived the key wasn\\'t there. Fortunately, after waiting for a while by the front door, people were leaving the building so I could sneak in and drop my luggage off upstairs. When going out for dinner the key problem remained.\\r\\n\\r\\nI understand that things like that can happen, in that case the host just needs to be available to resolve the issue. However, to make a long story short, Madison responded very unprofessionally and was plain rude. Didn\\'t believe the key was missing, was angry and making inappropriate comments. He even asked me to pay him extra 50 dollars to come over and arrange the key for me. Obviously I didn\\'t think that was reasonable and finally (a few phone calls and a couple of hours after being first informed about the situation) he sent his cleaning lady over. She was super polite, professional and apologized for the situation. She gave me her own key when she saw the lock box wasn\\'t where it was supposed to be. Apparently city authorities (or someone else) are removing the lock boxes from the fences. Again, things can happen but the host must be willing to manage the situation properly.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo sum up - Apartment is acceptable but host must improve his attitude towards his guests and establish a backup plan for key handover.\\r\\n Good points :\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location of the apartament is very very great, Madsion replies very quickly to questions. The flat is well located near times square and penn station. The room is clean, air Conditioning and wifi worked fine. There are many accessories in the apartment (iron, ironing board, umbrella, hair dryer...). The shop \"Brooklyn Fare\" is just on the left when you go out and the products are good.\\r\\n\\r\\nNegative points :\\r\\n\\r\\nBed too small for 2, and the futon is uncomfortable to sleep. The common areas are dirty (especially the bathroom) when the four rooms are occupied. It is impossible that the cleaning lady comes every day or she must be change.\\r\\n\\r\\nPs : Sheets are provided but please bring your own towels.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note that we had trouble when we arrived. The key retrieved in the lock box was not working. Madison did not answer the phone. We had to make do by ourselves to get into the building (thank you to the neighbor).\\r\\n The whole experience was quite terrible. Firstly, the key was not in the box as directed. Had to trek a few blocks to a Starbucks with my luggage, get on WiFi and contact Madison.  After that delay, couldn\\'t open the building\\'s door because of tricky key/loose lock situation. Others had this problem too.  After finally getting into the building with the help offered by a man (not what a single woman wants to have to accept for safety reasons, but I was getting a little desperate by then), and walking up 5 flights of stairs, got to the apartment door, with the neighbours\\' 2 dogs across the hall yapping incessantly.  They kept that up for hours, each day.  Room itself was unacceptable for the price, with uncovered lightbulb in ceiling for light, plastic bags stuffed around air conditioner as insulation, futon crease encrusted with dirt (hello cleaning lady?) so not touchable, no WiFi password left in room as promised so again required another trek to Starbucks to ask Madison about that, steep and high hike up to a bed with so little clearance for movement since the bed so close to ceiling, a small child would have had difficulty moving around. The neighbourhood itself was good in that it was very close to the Jacob Javitz centre but that alone should not be the reason anyone stays there.  Better to pay more money and not have to endure all the hassles that came with renting this place.  Madison was helpful and responsive, but if all these troubles had not arisen, he would not have needed to be involved in having to help and respond in the first place.  I honestly think he should not rent this place for more than $50/night.  At least then people would get a hint of what they were in for, and get \\'their money\\'s worth\\'.  At the $122/night I paid plus fees for  \\'cleaning\\' (and it was NOT clean) - I feel ripped off and would not want someone going through what I went through.  My daughter has had the opposite experience with Airbnb in terms of great value for the money. Airbnb should vet their \\'landlord\\'s\\' accommodation/advertising/pricing for more consistency in genuine representation of product.\\r\\n Clear process of reservation. Convenient location. Simple accommodations. Thank you, Madison!  This was the perfect location for my friend and I walking distance to most attractions near Times Square. The room is smaller than the other rooms in this apartment but we were aware of that when we booked and it was fine for us it had everything we needed. Area was safe we never had any issues and there is a great deli next door! I would stay here again but would book the bigger room next time! Thanks for the host Madison. Je n\\'ai jamais vu ni parlé à Madison, du moment où je suis arrivée jusqu\\'à mon départ. J\\'ai trouvé l\\'appartement sale et je n\\'avais pas du tout compris que le lit était une mezzanine. Etant fatiguée, ça ne m\\'a pas convenu du tout de dormir perchée et j\\'ai trouvé la chambre très vétuste. Les quatre étages à monter n\\'étaient pas simple avec mes bagages, heureusement, que le gentil voisin était là. Les salle de bain et toilettes étaient peu ragoutants. J\\'ai tout désinfecté avant d\\'y aller, mais n\\'ai pas mis les pieds dans la douche! Comme Madison n\\'est pas sur place, il n\\'y a personne pour faire en sorte que les autres convives, il y a quatre chambres en tout, laissent les lieux propres. La fenêtre de ma chambre avait un climatiseur ais il était orné de part et d\\'autre par des sachets plastiques. La prochaine fois, je prendrai le temps de lire les commentaires des autres visiturs... Aller chercher la clé de l\\'immeuble ailleurs n\\'était aussi pas un plaisir. Je ne reviendrai pas, ni ne recommanderai cette chambre à quiconque. J\\'aurais dû payer l\\'hôtel. Je ne savais pas quoi faire avec la clé de l\\'immeuble, je l\\'ai donc laissée dans ma chambre après l\\'avoir verrouillée. Juste parce que Madison répond rapidement, ne veut pas dire qu\\'il est disponible, en fait, c\\'est son business, de louer ces chambres. Les photos ne sont pas actuelles. Il n\\'a pas voulu m\\'en envoyer d\\'autres par mail quand je le lui ai demandé. Pro: Nice place, close to the times square & easy access to the rest of the city.\\nCon: not enough space for 2people, bed it way too small. Moisty, attracts bugs. \\n La habitación era tal cual aparecía en el anuncio. Tener en cuenta que queda en un piso 5 accesible solo por escaleras. El barrio es bastante tranquilo y cercano a las estaciones de la calle 34 (Linea 7 y E), hay un supermercado a menos de 10 pasos donde es posible encontrar de todo. El lugar posee cocina, pero con platos y servicios de plástico. Lo único malo de este lugar es el calefactor que se enciende a eso de las 5am y libera aire a presión a los pies de la cama lo que genera un gran ruido y me mantuvo despierto los últimos 3 días. El aire acondicionado también es bastante ruidoso. Me encanto el lugar muy limpio y cerca de todo ! Lo recomiendo ! We had a great stay.  Key was easy to find with great directions from Madison.  He was quick to respond to questions.  The room was clean and exactly as described.  I stayed at Madison\\'s Cozy Room #1 for 7 days from 10/22 thru 10/28.  Madison\\'s instructions for making the key pick-up were very detailed and made my check-in process extremely smooth.  My room was quite comfortable and was exactly as Madison described.  Madison\\'s entire apartment is very guest-friendly with access to a full kitchen, 2 bathrooms, and a very welcoming living room with a large sofa and big  flat-screen TV plus all kinds of incidentals.  Madison\\'s housekeeper Florie stopped by every morning to clean up and offer assistance and advice with any questions plus let all guests know her apartment number should any problems arise.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a very pleasant stay at Madison\\'s apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\nTony Janicki I would recommend not staying in Cozy Room # 1.  The bed for two is a twin size bed meant for one person.  It is too small for two people.  I had my face against the wall all night, and my husband had his against the railing of the loft bed.  The hot pipe that runs up the wall at the end of the bed burns your feet if you accidentally touch it in the middle of the night.  It also lets off noisy hot steam that wakes you up and makes the room unbearably hot.  The mattress is a piece of foam on top of plywood.  \\r\\nThe host does not live there but rents out four rooms, each with a combination lock on the door.   We received the wrong combination to begin with, and had to stall for a few hours before we could get in our room.  Then it malfunctioned one morning and locked us out.  The cameras all around the shared living room may be necessary, but do not make it feel warm an cozy.\\r\\nThey key pickup is half a block away around a corner.  The lock box is on a fence on the sidewalk.  It was only slightly difficult to find, but since it was dark and we had been flying all day, it was annoying.\\r\\nIt is a good location and fairly quiet.  We have stayed in 20 - 30 airbnb rooms all over the world, including others in New York City, and this is the only bad review I have ever felt the need to post. We had a little issue with password door in apartment at check-in, but Madison fixed very fast. \\r\\nWe didn\\'t meet Madison, but he answered all questions about the apartment very quickly.\\r\\nI would recommend not staying in Cozy Room # 1, but the other rooms I believe are more big.\\r\\nGood things:\\r\\n*The localization is nice, very close of Times Square.\\r\\n*The apartment was clean and common area is good.\\r\\n*Supermarket very close of apartment.\\r\\n*Easy to find the lock box on a fence on the sidewalk.\\r\\n*Bathroom was clean, depends too of the other people who stay there to keep this way.\\r\\n\\r\\nBad things:\\r\\n*so small bed for couples;\\r\\n*small room;\\r\\n*5 floor is bad for many luggages, because don\\'t have elevator, hard job to go upstairs.\\r\\n*The hot pipe that runs up the wall at the end of the bed burns your feet if you accidentally touch it in the middle of the night. It also lets off noisy hot steam that wakes you up and makes the room unbearably hot.\\r\\n*The Madison\\'s housekeeper didn\\'t clean our room after check-in, we stayed there 7 days.\\r\\n\\r\\nI might stay there again, but i will choose another room e not many luggages!\\r\\nWe liked to stay there! God beliggenhed. Mangelfuld rengøring og lettere ukomfortable sovepladser.  good I wouldn\\'t recommend renting this room if you have more than 1 person, as each Bed very small and only the top bed is comfortable to sleep on, the futon is as hard as a rock.  There is also this hot pipe that will cause you paid if you stretch your feet in the night and hit it which is likely, the pipe also blows out steam which makes the room very hot. Not even hand soap in bathroom, I left a bar for the next guest but be expected byo. Also it\\'s up 5 levels so pack light as there is no elevator.  \\n\\nPros: Location is great! This is the best thing about this. As you are 10-15 min walk from time square and macys etc. so if you book here, book the bigger room! \\n\\n Una amiga me lo recomendó ya que ella había hecho uso de esta pagina y no tuvo ningún problema.  the information Madison offered was very detailed and correct, very easy to find. Overall our experience of NY was awesome, but we felt the issues we had with the room did tarnish it a little. As for location, this place cannot be beat. 10 mins to Times Square, and a great base for exploring the city. It\\'s secure and although the street/neighborhood looks a bit suss, it\\'s not, that\\'s just NY. My main issues were that there were 2 of us and the sleeping arrangements aren\\'t suitable for 2. Sure there is a loft bed (which even though it is stated as a twin, is only meant for one) and the \\'bonus futon\\' that is actually meant to sleep the second person (so not a bonus really, just the second bed) is just way too hard and uncomfortable to suffice. It\\'s not a full size futon as described (it folds to the same width as the single loft bed) and doesn\\'t completely fold down in the space provided for it. Madison told me to move it length ways in the room but it doesn\\'t fit as the fixed ladder for the loft bed and the other furniture takes up too much space to do so. We made do and I removed the foam topper off the loft bed to put onto the futon so it was bearable for my partner to sleep on. Problem was that there were some nasty stains on it that looked like blood. Not good. Also we only had one blanket and two seperate beds. Also not good was that the one blanket did have blood stains on it! (& unwashed). As we had arrived from our flight late, I was forced to use it. The hot pipe that others have mentioned burning them has still not been dealt with. I found out that the building has steam heating, so in each room there are pipes running from floor to ceiling that have a valve at the top which periodically let\\'s out steam. The valve in room 1 is broken as it let\\'s out way too much steam (compared to the pipes in the rest of the apartment which are nearly silent) is very loud and therefore the pipe it\\'s attached to becomes extremely hot(the other pipes get warm to the touch). It is stationed at the end of the loft bed (and therefore the futon also) and you WILL be burnt throughout the night if you touch it. When I spoke to Madison about this he seemed surprised and was unsure of how I was getting burnt even though it\\'s quite obvious that others have brought this to his attention. He assured me that the bedding and pipe issues were going to be addressed the next day but they weren\\'t. I finally received clean bedding a day after that, but the burnt feet issue still wasn\\'t fixed by the time we left. The last issue I had was the cleanliness of the property. The housekeeper had visited the morning of check in but the place was pretty dirty.... Madison was awesome, great response time. The place was easy to get too with an awesome location. We loved it! Very attentive to my self-caused problems. Everything worked out quickly and simply. Room was everything I asked for and booked in a hurry. Ancienne maison assez différente de ce que l on peux voir d habitude \\nCommerciale car chaques chambre à son verrous donc pas de convivialité et on ne rencontre jamais le propriétaire ..\\nVersion hôtel \\nClef qui ouvre la porte une fois sur 10 \\nChauffage qui fait pssssss toute la nuit et donne envie de pisser :) Great location This place was just as described.  Nice low cost option for staying in Manhattan.  The apartment was clean, quiet, and had everything we needed.  The location is hard to beat.  Walking distance to the convention center and times square.  Lots of local parking for extended stay, and easy to access from the Lincoln Tunnel.  The room gets a little warm on the top bunk, and the steam pipe is a little noisy, but this is all pretty normal for NYC apartments.  Definitely recommend!  First, the pluses: If you\\'re going to the Javits Center as I was, there is nothing more convenient, barely 2 blocks away. And Madison was a very accommodating host, allowing me to leave my bags in the apartment both before and after checkout time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe minuses? Shower had soot (or black specks of something) covering the tub floor (was going to take a picture but no time for that); was gross and took 10 minutes to clean. And as others have noted, the private rooms are really tiny. I\\'m not a large person at all but felt very cramped; I certainly wouldn\\'t recommend for 2. Also, I know 5th floor walkups are a New York standard, but it\\'s trying.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother positive, though: I was bushed after a long day including an emergency landing of my flight and then convention parties. Happily, unit was very quiet and I slept like a log. Great hosting, place and location! Everything came out as it was acorded  Madison is a good host and made our arrival and key pickup/drop off very easy. \\r\\nThe room itself is rather small, but location-wise it\\'s perfect for exploring the city. Despite the feedback shared by other guests, bed was perfectly sufficient for 2 people. \\r\\nRegarding drawbacks, be aware that the heating pipe that other travelers have mentioned does cause problems - at some point of time it starts to release steam and is quite noisy when it does that (we had trouble falling asleep on the first day, but then got used to it). Due to that, be prepared that it may get quite hot inside, even if you open the window.\\r\\nFinally, on our last day we killed a cockroach in the room, which was not a pleasant feeling.  My aunt and uncle spent a great time in this apartment.  I went down to New York for the weekend with a friend and we both really enjoyed staying at Madison\\'s place. \\n\\nIt was in a great central location. Everything we wanted to do was either walking distance or easily accessible through close public transit. \\n\\nIt was a little tight with two people, but more importantly, it was clean and the bed was comfortable. \\n\\nMadison was very friendly and easy to get a hold of.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend his place to others. This is the perfect place to stay if money is a big concern, which was a big motivating factor for me. This place is a very low cost and those that choose this option should know that it is spare. It\\'s perfect, if you want to be near everything and only spending time at the home to sleep.   First of all, I would like to commend Madison for his swift, friendly responses to my questions. And the apartment is very well located. Second, if I am to be honest (and this is just to help Madison improve things), I would not descibe the room as \"cozy\", at all. It was functional and rather spartan (the wood ladder could be improved a bit). There were no extra sheets for the sofa bed (which I had enquired about using as I was traveling with my teenage son). I found a flat sheet and a comforter in the closet but those were obviously intended for the loft bed which, when we arrived, had only the fitted sheet on it. I therefore had to put the flat sheet and the comforter on the sofa bed so my son could sleep there, and I ended up sleeping with neither a top sheet nor a comforter. There was no soap (not even hand soap) or bath products in the bathroom. We only slept there a few hours as we only had one night in NYC but I feel the end price of 110 euros (59 for the room, and 36 for housecleaning and 15 for \"service\") a bit steep. 59 euros would have been more appropriate. Sorry for the negative elements but it\\'s to be helpful for the future. Also, please do warn guests about parking in the street across from the apartment (it\\'s only ok from 7pm to 7am).  La atención es muy buena, Madison siempre contesto rápido a los mensajes que le enviamos, aunque no lo hallamos (Website hidden by Airbnb) ubicación también es muy buena llegas caminando a todos lados.\\nLo malo es la suciedad del lugar, nunca limpiaron en los 3 días que estuvimos, ni  en los baños ni en la habitación, la alfombra del baño era un asco  We arrived at the apartment at about 1PM New York time and the key box where we were supposed to find our key was completely empty, the instructions given to us were very clear and specific and we had no actual trouble finding anything however when we emailed and called Madison about it he was working and it took three hours to hear back from him which was a bit of a bad situation as we had all of our suitcases with us and usually he was always very quick to respond. Luckily a nice lady let us into the building so we were able to go upstairs as the keys are only needed for the front doors and the room for the apartment nad the rooms in the apartmens work with a code which we had from the instructions. However we were not able to leave as we had no key so we had to wait for that. Eventually the cleaning lady came and gave us the key. The apartment itself was not very clean in my opinion but I guess everyone has their own standards on what is clean. The location for this apartment is great and all in all for the price of the apartment I would recommend it to others.  The location was good, but the bath and room was not really clean. Perfect location!! Room was ready and perfect for our arrival. The directions Madison gave us to the lock box were very detailed and easy to follow. He was very responsive when I had questions. We will stay here again next time we come to New York!!  Madison was very organized and on top of things for our stay. House rules were clearly laid out and all guests were very considerate of each other\\'s space. The location was great - right in restaurant territory. The room was a bit cramped for two people, but is what you would expect for NY. We had a nice stay. Nice cozy place, easy directions, and the owner was always available if something came up and would even check up on you to see how things are going. 5 stars! More if it was possible.  Positivo: la ubicación es muy buena, estas a 10 minutos  de times Square caminando.  Tiene lo necesario \\r\\n\\r\\nNegativo: la habitacion es pequeña, si no te gusta estar en la sala compartida no vas a tener mucho espacio  Madison was very detailed in instructions on how to get the key which made checking in easy! He was responsive from the beginning and answered any questions we had. This was our first Airbnb experience and I was very happy with it. The room looks just like the pictures and it was a clean and inviting space.  The room was private and had two ways to lock the door. The bed was ready and clean and actually pretty comfortable. The room also had its own mini fridge and AC. There was another guest in another room, but they were friendly! There were two shared bathrooms, both clean and ready. Madison\\'s place is in a great location! We were able to walk to his place from Times Square, it was awesome! I would recommend staying here!  Madison was a great host. We didn\\'t manage to catch up with him since we only stayed 1 night and left pretty early, however he was very responsive with any questions we had. Room was great! We stayed at Madisons appartement for the 4th of july weekend. The location is great and easilly accesible which was perfect. The apartment itself is basic. We thought it could have been cleaner, especially the bathroom, which also had no toiletpaper when we arrived. We did not get to meet Madison himself. It was quite a downer when we could not reach him when the keys were not at the location where he said they would be and had to wait outside the building for 30 min untill a neighbour helped us out. At other moments he was responsive. We would recommend this place if you are just looking for place to sleep at a good location. Right in the centre, very easy access, very clean and organised. The room was as described. We had minor confusion when we arrived as we couldn\\'t figure out the key situation, but another person in the apartment was very helpful and we got in. The room was clean and cozy and was perfect for our needs. Looking at the pictures, I didn\\'t realize that the bunk bed is a double, so my daughter slept with me in the bunk. The sofa is very uncomfortable. Madison responds pretty quickly and is willing to help. We would recommend his place. Thanks Madison!! This was my first time using Airbnb and it was adventourous. Anytime I had a question for Madison, he was quick with a response. His place reminded me of a shard college dorm. Room a little tight but not a problem when with your loved one. Thank you Madison!! La estancia ha sido muy agradable, y las  personas encontradas también, muy céntrico, solo una sugerencia en lo alto de la escalera debería tener algo acolchado porque al poner la rodilla en el filo de la cama hace daño...lo demás todo correcto, gracias. Madison\\'s gig is a well oiled machine.  The check in process is quick.  He answers messages almost instantly.  The space is quite comfortable.  Definitely a good alternative to staying in a hotel. Good location. Clean. I will definitely stay there again. 타임스퀘어를 걸어갈수있는위치(어차피 지하철이 매우 잘되어있음 오히려 조금 걷는게 귀찮)\\r\\n개인적인 공간\\r\\n\\r\\n을 강력하게 선호하는 사람만 방문하세요\\r\\n\\r\\n이 가격이라면 그냥 호스텔 가겠습니다. 좁아터진방, 엘리베이터도 없는 5층, 침대가 이층침대처럼 사다리타고 올라가야되서 에어컨틀면 냉기가 안올라옴 \\r\\n\\r\\n그냥 딱들어갔을때 물리고싶었습니다. 어쩔수없이머무르긴했지만 Nice location and good communication! This is my second time visit his room because I had good experience in this location last time. Great place to stay. Very accessible, close to both times square and subway stations. Clean, secure and functional. Madison is always just a message away and is very quick to respond. The only feedback I have is about the air conditioning which sometimes fails to circulate to the bed which is in the upper half of the room. \\nWould definitely love to come back! I enjoyed my stay at Madison\\'s. The room was really cosy and he allowed me to leave my baggage behind for a bit to have my lunch after my check-out. Truly a kind soul! This room was a good deal in a very convenient neighborhood. Be aware that the furnishing and amenities are sparse. The location of this room could not have been better, and it was an amazing value for the price! \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a slight issue finding the key at check-in (lock-box was empty) but Madison responded to my text almost instantly with a solution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis room DOES NOT have a futon as suggested in the listing. It has a broken little 5-foot-long fold out couch with metal bars running through it...the floor would be more comfortable. We had two people and we ended up sharing the loft bed which was totally comfortable, but you should know that if you have two people you will be sharing the bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was clean enough, and the rest of the amenities were exactly as described! Overall an amazing value for an amazing neighborhood. We were steps from the Javits Center and didn\\'t have to use any transit at all during our stay because we were close enough to walk everywhere. I would stay here again just for the value and the location. The place was neat and tidy but had dust on shelves in the closet. The room is really small but if you\\'re looking for a relatively cheap place for a short stay near penn station this will do for a couple nights. Madison provided really good instructions to allow us to get into the property and was very good at getting back to us quickly to sort out any problems. The property is in a great location for getting around and seeing everything in New York. The room is exactly as shown in the photos and was fine for us as we weren\\'t there very much at all. The only slight problem was that the air con doesn\\'t reach the bed as it is underneath it and therefore it can get pretty hot at night! Overall though we had a good stay!  Very good  We were e-mailed final details day of and got the apartment smoothly. It was very close to the convention center which was perfect and there were plenty of restaurants near by.  Hi Madison,\\r\\nafter our problems at the start lockbox and the mysterious doors, we were very happy with our flat. Thank you for the wonderful days in our room. It was great!\\r\\nBecause of you, we were in the heart of NY! It was very easy to get everywhere with walking our the Subway.\\r\\nA lovely advice from two housewives:)\\r\\nIf the beds are full , ist wouldnt be bad to clean the Fluor in the bathroom.\\r\\nAgain, thank  you for everything!\\r\\nIt was very great!,\\r\\nRuth and Carola\\r\\n The room was perfect \\nYou can use the kitchen Madison helped us out by allowing us to drop off our luggage prior to check in. Note that it you are able to do this, you will have to leave your things in the common room. But we had no troubles with this. Try to pack lightly because those four flights of stairs are narrow. The apartment is quieter than we expected. Hot water seemed to keep up. With demand. Bathrooms were very clean. Would be nice if they supplied wash cloths along with the towels. Location is pretty good. 15 minute walk to 34th Street-Penn Station and close enough to Times Square and the theatres.  Good location and great value! Bon logement pour la découverte de la ville personne disponible par le site!  The apartment was very close to the Convention Center, so close I was able to stop in between sessions during the day.  There were many local delis and a pharmacy around the corner. Broadway district was in walking distance as well.  I enjoyed my stay immensely.  La zona es muy tranquila y cercana de estaciones del Tren subterraneo, El departamento siempre estuvo limpio y con todos los servicios, pequeño refrigerador, plamcha dentro del cuarto, y la cocina estaba equipada para poder cocinar y comer en el departamento. En general muy buena experiencia. Perfect location - steps to time square! The room was comfortable and we received quick responses before the trip! Definitely will be back  The apartment was super convenient to Times Square and walking distance to everything we planned to do. Although we didn\\'t get to meet Madison he  gave great checkin instructions to ensure we had a smooth process. The space was exactly as described and the price worked well for our stay. Would definitely make this one of my NY faves. Madison\\'s place is excellent. With so many sights, sounds, and attractions all within walking distance but just far enough away from the noise, the location is unbeatable. The space itself is clean and while other Airbnb\\'ers share a common area, the bedroom room has its own personal lock and code for you to maintain your privacy. Madison as a host was great. He was able to help my fiancé and I out on extremely short notice. While we didn\\'t get the chance to meet, Madison was fantastic in replying to questions ranging from house rules, directions to the space, and recommending places to eat. I couldn\\'t have gotten any luckier with a great host and a great space. Definitely coming back to NY in the future and Madison\\'s will be the first place I look! Es war super, super Lage nur zu empfehlen  The location of the apartment is amazing. It\\'s just a few minute walk to Times Square and other great attractions. The room is small, but that\\'s expected. The bed was very comfortable.  Great location for our stay in Manhattan. We had difficulty accessing the apartment due to the key not being in the spot where the instructions had said. However, a neighbour kindly let us in and once we had access to wifi to communicate with Mason, he was very speedy with his responses. The apartment was true to how the pictures and description states, however the cleanliness was slightly below standards I would have personally expected. Overall, we had a really good stay at Mason\\'s place and thought it was good value for money. Madison\\'s place is in a great location, within walking distance to everything we wanted to see in NYC. The room was clean and spacious. Madison was also very responsive to questions emailed to him. The instructions on how to get the key from the lockbox were clear and I had no trouble. I was surprised that it was pretty quiet at night. The only noise you could hear from outside was the occasional siren. Thanks very much. We had a pleasant stay. Good location, nice small room, you have to climb 5 floor (in case you have walking issue ) and good for young traveler. Madison is great and careful. Always ready to ping you back   I enjoyed staying here and will do again if I have business in Manhattan. It\\'s close to everything that\\'s important. Great host, usually replies within 10 minutes. Rooms are exactly the same as the pictures.  Madison\\'s place was perfect for a small quick trip to NYC. Easy to get to and close to many areas! Would definitely try it again! Madison was a great host, I felt very at home and safe in this listing. 10/10 would stay again! Great deal.  Room got a little warm for me, but it was fine Fantastic stay. This is a perfect location and fantastic deal for the area. I\\'ve stayed here twice, and will again. A nice place, very private, with lock on the bedroom doors and clear instructions to check-in.  Madison\\'s place was great and close to everything! Would definitely stay here again Madison was a great host.  The place was clean and minimalist.  Appreciated the ease of check in! Great Spot!  Easy to follow instructions regarding checking in sent the day before.  Really quick replies to any questions asked.  Only complaint - there is a heating pipe located close to the bed that would go on and off with hissing sounds throughout the night, but guessing it can\\'t be helped.  Overall we were really happy with our stay. Place was clean, saw a couple other guests staying in other rooms, but was never an issue, everyone followed the rules set out, were quiet late at night.  Would stay again.   We didn\\'t see our host, but the place was efficient and convenient. This is a convenient stay for anyone who just needs a place to crash while exploring the city. I\\'d recommend Madison\\'s place to other Airbnb guests anytime.  I would definitely recommend this stay. Madison was very responsive and the room was perfect location.  - Lo mejor sin duda fue la ubicación, hicimos casi todo caminando.\\n- Limpieza, nunca vimos a nadie pero un día nos dejaron una toalla y el departamento siempre estuvo limpio.(Se respetaron las reglas de convivencia entre los huespedes).\\n- La habitación era pequeña, tenía un entre piso que era solo cama para 2 personas, tv, una heladerita, placard, y un sofa. Tenía una escalera para subir, lo cual puede incomodar(nosotros no tuvimos problemas).\\n\\nSegún mi experiencia, volvería a alquilar. \\n Great place to stay! Easy check in and plenty of room.  위치도 터미널이랑 가깝고 타임즈 스퀘어나 엠파이어빌딩 등 쪽으로도 가기에도 편하고 다운타운으로 가기에도 좋앗어요~ I recommend this place. Very clean, good instructions, immediate responses. Very functional and in my case in the perfect location close to Javits Center. The high bed was surprisingly comfortable.  very near to Jacob convention center Place is as described! La ubicación del apartamento es muy Central, con fácil acceso al Time Square, restaurantes y estaciones de metro \\nLa habitación tal cual como se muestra en la Foto ( pequeña ) y el anfitrión atento a cualquier recomendación  Had a great time in New York, great communication with Madison and loved our room. Our stay at Madison\\'s house was great. It\\'s crazy central located, just 5 walking minutes to Times Square and also lots of other central points (bus tours, metro stations) are nearby. The flat was really clean, especially the bathrooms. Unfortunately, we had a a room with a quite noisy heater that sizzled sometimes a bit. However, we would ever come back for our next stays! Very central and close to everything at the Times Square region  Perfect for a couple of nights in the heart of New York City, with a comfortable bed and a quiet room. El alojamiento es tal cual se muestra en las fotos. La ubicación es espectacular. La comunicación con el anfitrión muy buena. Lo único que no nos gustó es que en la conocía había cucarachas, lo que no nos permitía cocinar.. la basura se acumulaba. \\nAgradezco de todos modos la estadía Exactly as described!  Just what we expected! This place is all you need for coming home after a long day in the city. Great location, and very comfy bed. Would stay again for sure, great value for exactly what is advertised! 10-15 minute walk to Penn Station. Bedroom is small, but clean. Did not have to use taxi or subway for my visit, as a lot of places are walking distance. Be aware that this room is located on the 5th floor, with no elevator. That can serve as a built-in stair-stepper instead of going to a gym. The area is very quiet. Full kitchen is available, but I did not use it. Room has a \\'steam valve\\', which can be noisy, but it only was on for short periods. Be aware that the bed is a \\'loft bed\\', so it will be like going to summer camp, with being on the top bunk. It would be very snug for 2 people, as it is about the size of a twin mattress. The mattress was very comfortable. Be sure to avoid going to bed drunk or stoned, because if you have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, the ladder could be tricky. Hope your insurance would cover that sort of thing. Could not located a hair dryer, but I am sure Madison will find it for next visit. Madison was very quick to respond to my initial question. Good value for people on a budget, as I do not like spending $300 or more for a hotel.  Check-in was easy, place was clean, and we felt safe. The room was smaller than we expected, but the description does say cozy, but all we did was sleep there, and it was convenient to everything. It is a shared bathroom - one full bath, and one half bath. Sharing with others didn\\'t cause any issues. Thanks! I wanted a place to sleep that was close to all of the Broadway theatres, and Madison\\'s place was perfect for that. He was very accurate in his descriptions, so we knew we would have five flights to climb. The room was clean and we were mostly there to just sleep and shower. It is within walking distance to Times Square and close to grocery stores and restaurants. Madison was very communicative, responsive, and friendly. I would plan to book this place for future trips! The location of the place is good, it is safe and the bed very comfortable, however it was very dirty everywhere.  If it improves the cleanliness the place looks perfect. Very clean place. Awesome location.\\nMadison is a great host!! Great location and easy to pick up. The bed was very comfortable and easy to get into. The bed is bunk bed style with the bed up top and a mini couch underneath. Keep in mind the way up is a ladder affixed to the frame for stability. Very quiet room with air conditioner, tv, mini fridge and desk area.  Great location and value for money. We were able to sit in the shared area for an hour after check out before our travel plans Very conveniently located and the host is very responsive. Madison\\'s place was easy to find and within walking distance to bars, restaurants, cafes and shops. The room was perfect for two to share for a night. \\n\\nNo hand soap/hand towel provided so make sure to pack your own! Its very good located but thats the only good thing to say :( \\nIt was not clean, you can\\'t look out of the windows because they are sooo dirty, lots of hair in the bathroom and also in the bath towels  Great location and value for exploring midtown. Room is cozy but we had everything we needed.  Great location.  Great value. Alles wie beschrieben. Madison\\'s apartment was perfect for my first trip to New York. Being able to stay right in the heart of Manhattan near all the hot spots for such an affordable price is great. Madison was extremely helpful with letting me know how to get into the place, and answered all my questions quickly. I\\'ll definitely stay here again next time in in the city! It was a nice and clean place. It\\'s location makes it very convenient to commute. I recommend this place. Madison was excellent in answering questions prior to arrival and instructions for getting into the building, apartment, and room were clear. I stayed three nights. It\\'s a fifth floor walk-up. My room was simple with a loft bed, which was kind of fun climbing up into each night - reminded me of being a kid again. There was also a small couch beneath the loft bed that laid down flat to make another bed, if needed. While it was basic and simple, Madison included amenities like a TV and cable box in this room (I assume also in the others), an iron, a small fridge, and the great wi-fi. The commons area was tidy with a kitchen available and cable TV. My room had no view, perhaps the other 3 or 4 rooms did, I don\\'t know, but a view wasn\\'t needed. This is a great basic place to lay your head at night and good value for the money. This is a great place to stay. The room is small but it\\'s totally workable. I would stay here again.  Buena ubicación, lamentable que no haya ascensor (5to piso).  Las comodidades son según se describen. Lugar para estar como máximo 3 días.  Madison\\'s space was a great place to stay! Honestly it was so close to all the places my boyfriend and I wanted to go visit. Everything was walking distance or a quick Lyft / subway trip away. The space was sooo clean. The mini fridge inside the room was helpful too! There is an air conditioner in the room however since there is a loft bed, it can get hot at night since heat generally rises. Also, the bathroom sinks get hot during the day however I believe that\\'s just due to the hot summer weather. Other than that I really enjoyed my stay and Madison was GREAT with communication. Thanks again! Really good location, with everything you needed for a great stay!  Lage super, Kommunikation mot Madison Problemlos :) kleines süsses zimmer :)  Small room but perfect for sightseeing etc. Very close to Times Square and Empire State Building . Easy to access . As mentioned in the add it is on the fifth floor but it\\'s worth it for being so central . Really enjoyed our stay here . One small thing is that the key was a bit difficult to use in the front door but this is probably a problem with the building and not the host (the host did warn us about this beforehand) . Overall a great experience.  La ubicación es lo mejor de esta habitación, a unos 15 minutos de Times Square. Lo demás deja bastante que desear, especialmente la limpieza de todo el piso, habia cucarachas en la cocina y la habitación, hay una cocina como muestran las fotos pero no hay utensilios para cocinar, ni un simple vaso. En verano por la noche es insoportable el calor, aún con el aire acondicionado encendido, ya que al estar la cama en un altillo, el aire frio no sube hacia arriba.  El alojamiento muy bueno,lo re recomiendo. La ubicacion estaba buenaa..cerca de todo. Y el departamento nos gusto.. cada uno tiene su espacio y esta bueno como esta distribuido. Medio cansador el tema de que no haya asensor. Pero totalmente que volveria y lo recomendaria !! The proximity of this room to Times Square, shows, restaurants and public transit is ideal for someone who wants to do it all while in NYC. \\n\\nThe only downside to our stay was the temperature. I\\'m a southern girl, so humidity and high temperatures are nothing new to me. The apartment was very warm, and it was difficult to feel cool and comfortable, especially after walking so much throughout the day and dancing, which was the purpose of my trip. \\n\\nMadison was a great communicator and I appreciated his promptness in answering questions for us throughout the week.  Loved that there were two restrooms Great stay!  Great location and great value. Everything was very clean going in. Just be weary of other guests and show courtesy to them as they could potentially be asleep. But if you\\'re looking to find a good way to immerse into New York culture at a great price, it\\'s a great booking. Less than a ten minute walk to Penn station which takes you everywhere in the city, a market in the next building over, and a location right near the Lincoln tunnel crossing, which keeps the street relatively quiet at night.  Bom preço para a localização. Um pouco sujo e a cozinha não tem utensílios praticamente nenhuns. Comunicação com o proprietário foi sempre muito eficiente  The location is relly great for exploring the city, just  few blocks down from Times Square and right next to Hells Kitchen. The room was ok and spacious enough for two people and a couple of days stay. But we were not sure that sheets and towels were clean or changed after the last guests, finding old band aids from former guests  in the sheets is not a great way to wake up. Also the kitchen was only equipped with plastic and styrofoam plates and a few plastic knives, no spoons, forks, whatsoever. If you just want a place to sleep, this is great. But cooking and travelling on a budget is a little difficult. We very much enjoyed our trip to New York and Madison\\'s place was perfect for the occasion. The room was clean and we had no problem with other guests. The apartment is situated in a prime location and despite the accommodation being simple it provided everything we needed for our stay.\\nMadison was flexible with check in time and was quick to respond to communications. This place is a very very nice place, very clean, near to time square and all the bets places of new york.. Madison\\'s place is surprisingly quiet given its proximity to Times Square, which is, of course, another one of the positives.  The apartment was clean and tidy and a comfortable place to rest.  I would have no hesitation to book it again. Very good apartment, good location. Considering the price, the dirt in the bathroom was ok. I really do recommend this apartment! Thanks! Lo mejor del apartamento la ubicación!! Increíble! \\nEl apartamento tal y como aparece en las fotos: pequeño pero más que suficiente para dormir y descansar! \\nHubiera agradecido algo más de limpieza, pero estaba correcto! \\nLa comunicación con Madison fue perfecta y la entrada y salida fue sencilla cuando nosotros quisimos! \\nRecomendable para gente joven, viajera, aventura,...\\nOjo es un cuarto sin ascensor (se hacia muy fácil subir) y la cama está en un altilllo y hay que subir con una escalera!\\nRecomendable! Muchas gracias Great location. The price is perfect for what it is. Enjoyed the stay very much, I\\'d stay there again. Great communication with the host, excellent location. Slept like a baby :) Best deal in town.  The check in sounds complicated but is actually very easy.  Easy to find and amazing location.  Cannot beat it.  Room/apartment was also great! Madison is a wonderful host. His place is cozy, quant and situated in a great location. Walking distance to everyting. I have absolutely no complains. Excellent location with easy access to supermarkets and restaurants \\nAffordable price in the big apple The place looks like the pictures. The neighbors in the building are really nice. The apt location was great, we walked everywhere. The other people staying in the apt were barely heard or seen and everything was clean. Great place to stay! I would stay here again. This is my second time staying at Madison’s place and it will continue being my top choice when visiting NYC. Great location, value, and Madison is very communicative and a great host. Great values. The apartment is close to everything.  Easy check in and out. It was close to Time\\'s square. He was nice person and replied very quickly. Thanks to his, my stay in NY was awesome. Black marks on both towels in the room, no hand soap in the bathroom, and even though they said they will bring them after I told them, they never did, I doubt it that they ever change the sheets between guests. Very tiny small room not worth it at all for the price they charge. This listing is great if are looking for minimal amenities and just a room to stay at night. The room was not that large but two-three people could easily fit. The shower was not clean because some earlier tenants did not feel the need to clean it. It’s right in Hell’s Kitchen and close to many bars and restaurants. Overall it was a positive experience but in the future I would choose somewhere else Overall, the stay was great. We felt we have our own space altho it\\'s shared as the flat was secured perfectly.\\n\\nThe common areas like kitchen, living room and toilets are all clean. The location is ideal!! Easy to get to public transportation. Market is just a few steps away. \\nLoft with full size bed on top. Clean sheet, cotton blanket and two pillows were provided. Great pillows btw. Futon is worn that\\'s below the loft but I\\'m sure that\\'s just bc of the amount of people who pass through. Room was clean. Had a small trash can for us. That was nice so we didn\\'t have to go to the kitchen to throw small things away. The Window ac worked well. We stayed in November and most nights the temps were cool so no need for AC :)Room had a mini fridge which was great!! \\nLoved the power strip in the room!! There\\'s a closet to put luggage in. A few hangers are provided. Large wall mirror in room was nice to get ready for the day or evening. Quiet neighborhood. We would definitely stay again. Host was very quick to respond to messages sent Super easy to get in and out. I can\\'t say enough good things about his place!!! Very good place to stay, very close proximity to the Javits center and other great midtown locations. Had a great stay if your looking for something simple and just a place to sleep and shower. The place is a good spot for getting around Manhattan. Host communication is great. The place is not as clean as we like a home, but it served its purpose. \\n Simple-secure-clean...good location close to bus terminal, subway and Times Square. It\\'s a small room, but definitely worth the value if you\\'re just looking for a place to crash for the night. It was everything we needed for our stay, and comfortable, too: the AC was a definite plus, and there was plenty of room for two on the bed. We didn\\'t end up having to interact with anyone during our stay, which was nice, too - it made check-in and check-out super easy and simple. Thumbs up for sure. The perfect place for a getaway to NYC. Provides exactly what it says. Excellent value. Will be my preferred place to stay if travellng here again! Madison was an excellent host and most things were as expected. The location is quite good with Times Square about a 15 minute walk away. The apartment is on the 5th floor, so it’s 4 flights of stairs up. The only unexpected thing was the heating system was quite loud when we slept (because the building is old), but you get used to it. I was quite worried about the apartment being warm enough during one of the colder weeks in NYC this year. My fears were misplaced as the entire place was warm and toasty due to the piped steamed heating in all the rooms. The 5 flights of stairs were pretty effortless as the flights are quite short. Madison was super-communicative in arrangements that were clear and to the point. The sleeper couch in the room is quite uncomfortable and needs replacement, but overall the place was clean, had all the basics and was quite secure. A great location as well! The location, the check in and the communication was great and super easy! \\n\\nPerfect stay for one night Our room was on 5th floor, the stairs are relatively steep and narrow. Room is small, but there\\'s enough space for 2 big peaces of luggage. There\\'s also a refridgerador. The heating system was a bit strange for us, and really loud at times, such that it may interrupt your sleep. Bathrooms could be cleaner. Location is great, close to subway and times square. Host is very friendly. All in all not a bad choice. PRO\\nMadison responded quickly to messages. Building was easy to find and close to public transit. Very close to a convenience stores. Appears to be security cameras. Two fairly clean bathrooms, trash was taken out. \\n\\nCON\\nThe only coffee pot was high in the cabinet and out of my reach. NO SMOKE OR FIRE ALARMS HOOKED UP. \\nThere were no sheets or pillow cases on the bed.  Our TV remotes didn\\'t have batteries.\\n\\nAll in all this is a fine crash pad  but could be really nice with a few minor touches like sheets and pillow cases on the beds and a smoke detector or two. It\\'s a small loft room that can get musty and hot in the winter (right next to a steam heater), but it\\'s in a great location at a decent price. Madison was very responsive, which was a major plus! We stayed here for four days and this place was very close to Times Square, which was great. However we smelled of a gas leaking and we had to leave because other residents told us that there may be a danger of explosion. Can\\'t beat the location and the loft was cozy. Good location! Very Clean. Communication was good. I recomend to leave the dishes visible avaiable. But I would back. I liked! Casa bene ubicata ma molto sporca. Polvere ovunque e raganatele. Peli e capelli nelle lenzuola e nei bagni. Per il resto buona ubicazione great location. close to everything. M & J responded quickly. would come back again. Die Unterkunft ist sehr schön gelegen und es hat alles sehr gut mit dem Check-in geklappt. Eine etwas laute Heizung, welche aber nicht weiter stört. Die Unterkunft ist sehr weiter zu empfehlen. Perfect location and we enjoyed our stay. We do have some comments about the place. We only got one towel each for a six days stay. Overall the place wasnt too clean. There was a lot of dust, and for example items of previous tenants, things that could be easily fixed. There also is quite a lit of noise from the heaters which could be disturbing at night. This place is great for a short stay!! Esta muy cerca de Porth Autory, genial para traslados desde cualquier aeropuerto.\\nLa cama esta en alto y hay que subir una escalera de madera, porqué esta en un altillo, apto solo para personas jóvenes.\\nPocos enchufes dentro de la habitación.\\nSi da servicio de toallas y secador de pelo.\\nEl apartamento es un 5 sin ascensor.\\nBarrio tranquilo, ninguna inseguridad, cercano a puestos de comida y farmacia.\\nCalefacción perfecta y siempre agua.\\n caliente. \\nComunicación con anfitrión siempre correcta, aunque nunca accommodation was good. On Manhattan very cheap and right in the center, I recommend. There was no insect in the apartment, we looked everywhere. We would come again. Bon emplacement. Appartement fonctionnel avec possibilité de se restaurer sur place (plus une grande supérette  au pied de l’immeuble). Propreté très limite dans la salle de bain même si celle ci dépend aussi des autres résidents... Problème (parfois) de bruit important d évacuation d air par un tuyau dans la chambre : à 6h du matin cela réveille ! Aucun pb pour accéder à l appartement lors de notre arrivée à une heure très avancée (2h du matin) grâce à la clé se trouvant dans une boite fermée par un code (reçu quelques heures avant notre arrivée) à l entrée de l immeuble. \\nN hésitez pas à vous rendre dans cette ville incroyable  ! La ubicación es excelente, se encuentra a 12 minutos caminando a Times Square, nosotros nos íbamos muy temprano por la mañana y volvíamos tarde por tanto nos ha gustado mucho. Quizá las estancias podían estar más limpias, pero en general hemos estado bien, ya que sólo íbamos a dormir y ducharnos. La comunicación con Madison es muy buena y contesta rápidamente a todo. If you want to be accessible to Times Square or the Javits Center on a budget, this place is perfect. For those who are disabled or even just over 30, be advised that there are five flights of stairs without an elevator and a ladder to the bed. For those with strong legs, it\\'s a great price for a great location. Wir haben eine Woche in dieser Unterkunft gewohnt und waren leider sehr enttäuscht. Das Badezimmer war sehr schmutzig und Schimmel war an den Decken. Sowohl im Badezimmer als auch im Schlafzimmer. Ich hab den Gastgeber kontaktiert und er wirkte sehr hilfsbereit und meinte er schaut sich das an ob die Reinigungskraft nicht gut geputzt hat, aber seiner Meinung nach war alles in Ordnung. Wenn ihre diese Unterkunft Bucht nehmt unbedingt Flipflops mit! Ich kann diese Unterkunft leider nicht weiterempfehlen. The space was exactly what I wanted, a nice place to sleep in at night while I explored the city during the day. You can\\'t beat the location, only a few blocks from Times Square! M & J\\'s place was in a great location - 5 minute walk from Times Square, subway stations and Greyhound bus station.  The room was as described, cosy!! Only issues we had were with the cleanliness of the place, and the wifi not being great in the room. Room was covered in dust and felt in need of a good clean. No hand soap in bathrooms, which were also not as clean as expected. Overall, good value and great location! El apartamento esta bastante bien, yo lo recomendaria e incluso volveria a usarlo. El unico problemilla que el aire acondicionado esta debajo de las camas y no llega bien, con lo cual se pasa un pcoo de calor en los doas calurosos. Pero todo bien. Echoing most other reviews. Great location and price. Communications were also good. They are very responsive. I would stay there again, because of the location and price. Very small room good for short stay. Not very clean, the location is good.\\nM &J gave me quick responses. Great location! Easy access to metro!  good location, not as new and fresh looking as in pics. Everything about the location was perfect for going to Javits. For the money, 110% worth it for the location. Clean bed and sheets, all good. Nice place to stay for a good price!  GREAT LOCATION!!!\\nIt was easy to find the apartment, we landed on LaGuardia airport and we took a the Subway to the apartment.  It\\'s very close to the Subway and it\\'s at the heart at Time Square. The only downside was the flight of stairs you have to take to get to the apartment, everything else was perfect. I would defiantly stay this place again in the future.  Very good location and perfect for sightseeing around Manhattan Muy cómodo y con una buena ubicación, cerca de todo This place has charm and is in a great location for lots of sight seeing and eats! We spent all day out and about walking to many locations and enjoyed the convenience of the store nearby for a quick grab.  Great place to stay would differently book again when I’m in the city. Walking distance to everything. It’s on the fifth floor just be prepared for the steps. Host were nice an friendly an responded fast.  We arrived late at night to find no key where they said it would be and unfortunately had to get a hotel as we couldn’t reach the host, however this was resolved very quickly the next day. The apartment is in a fantastic location however is quite dirty/dusty and has no products or electrical equipment available for guests to give their own room a little spring clean. Overall the exproence was pleasant and check out was very easy.  If all you\\'re looking for is a place to sleep in one of the most famous cities in the World then this is all you need. Very basic but all necessities are provided. You\\'re not going to spend much time in the room anyway. Rooms were clean! They even had a mini-fridge! The place was within walking distances to every place and even some places for a quick bite! Me and my girlfriend felt safe here! Nice room, great price near everything older NYC building. I always wanted to experience what living in in the city was like.  Thx!  location is so so nice but that\\'s it Nice small room in a really great location in the heart of NYC. Do, however, bring your own soap! Apart from that, ideal for what we needed. Great location but the cleanliness was a real disappointment. The room seemed okay but the shared areas wasn’t the nicest. Went to use the toaster one day and when I moved it a million bugs came running from underneath it. I also had a question about check out and didn’t get any response. Other than that it was an okay accommodation. Wouldn’t book again though Room was exactly as detailed on the ad. It was very hot while we were there and the air con in the room was wonderful. Appreciated that each room had a combination lock on the door so our belongings were safe. We were very happy with the location. Would stay again on our next trip to NYC. Good value if you\\'re just looking for a place to lay your head. Two of us explored on food, and it\\'s in a good area if you\\'re looking to pop in and out throughout the day Great place and location in Manhattan! Tiny cosy place in a great location. Perfect for one night travellers. Wonderful place within walking distance to the attractions we were in town to see.  Would happily stay again. Great location! Des propriétaires disponibles, et réactifs. Tout était comme annoncé. Suffisant pour la journée que je devais passer sur place Affordable place to stay. Not the same as in pictures but manageable. The keys were not available until 7pm when the check in time is 2pm. If this happens to you, try to contact the host through Airbnb messaging system. Don’t call or text the cell phone listed in the listing. You will get no response. Die Lage der Wohnung ist super. Das Zimmer sehr klein und mit einem Hochbett nicht wirklich schön. Die Hygiene und Sauberkeit lässt sehr zu wünschen übrig, damit meine ich kleine tierische Mitbewohner im Schlafzimmer, Staub und Dreck (Haare usw) sowohl im Schlafzimmer als auch im Badezimmer. An den Decken finden sich in den Badezimmern und leider auch bei uns im Zimmer Flecken, die sehr nach Schimmelbefall aussehen. Die Kommunikation mit den Vermietern war gut. Wir würden aufgrund des Hygienemangels ,auch wenn der Preis sehr günstig war, nicht noch einmal dieses Zimmer buchen und würden es auch keinem empfehlen. Location is perfect for visiting NYC.  Everything is within a short walking distance.  Price is great too. Michael was very sympatic with us and really helpful.\\r\\nThe apartment is well located, really close to Brodway jonction subway station, 20 min from Manhattan.\\r\\nIt s a good plan if you are looking for a cheap accomodation in NYC!\\r\\n Very nice host\\nNeighbourgs a bit noisy\\nPerfect for a cheap week-end in NYC Michael was very helpful and accommodating for our stay. He made the whole process very easy for us! Good value for the stay and convenient to all of Brooklyn and getting back to Manhattan. The apartment building was a little loud but it was Halloween anyway :) Great place for the money. Convenient to the Subway Perfect for the price and convenient to the subway. Michael was very helpful and check in on me during my stay. He was also very flexible and allowed me to extend my reservation. Michael\\'s place was great. He was great and made me feel very welcome. This is a great place if you are looking for a comfortable place to lay your head Solid place to stay. Host was very helpful, would book again. Michael was a great host. Place was clean, perfect for my weekend get a way. Michael is a wonderful host and made an effort to help and make me feel welcomed. The location is very convenient for commuting to the city as it is very close to Broadway Junction subway station. I recommend this as a low-cost option for sleeping in Brooklyn. Just note that the neighbors may be a bit noisy. Michael was a very awesome host. He made a lot of efforts to solve any problems I had, like helping me carry my luggage from the subway station. He also replied to my messages quickly enough during my stay.\\r\\nThe apartment was on the ground floor and looked exactly like the pictures. All the facilities (heating, hot water, WiFi, kitchen, etc.) worked well and Michael prepared a lot of useful things in the kitchen and the bathroom for me to use. Going to Manhattan from the apartment was quite convenient, although it usually took about 30 minutes. The only negative thing was that the neighbors were playing really loud music for the very first nights, however I told Michael about it and he talked to the neighbors. After that it was better.\\r\\nThe streets around the apartment were really dirty with a lot of trash. On the way to the Broadway Junction subway station, I had to go through a tunnel which has a horrible smell. I was a bit scared by the neighborhood when I arrived because I thought it would be unsafe. But nothing bad ever happened to me, so it\\'s fine :)\\r\\nOverall, this is a very nice and economical place to stay in New York City.  Great little place to stay close to the Atlantic Ave train station. Michael was very accommodating and stayed to show us around the apartment. Although the neighbors can be a bit loud, I would definitely recommend this place for a nice visit. Points positif : Hôte sympatique qui à guider notre chauffeur de taxi à destination,\\r\\nMichael nous à expliquer où était le métro.\\r\\n- Métro proche + petite épicerie\\r\\n\\r\\nPoints négatif ( beaucoup) : ne correspond pas vraiment au photos\\r\\n- Odeur de \"pas propre\" à notre entrée même en ouvrant les fenêtres toute la journée le soir en rentrant c\\'était pareil\\r\\n- PETITS CAFARDS qui se baladaient \\r\\n- VOISINS très bruyant musique tôt le matin jusqu\\'à tard la nuit !\\r\\n- plusieurs déchets poser partout ( bouteille d\\'alcool, gobelet..)\\r\\n- lit hyper mou ( j\\'ai encore mal au dos après 1 semaine) \\r\\n\\r\\nbref personne sympatique mais appart INSALUBRE je ne recommande pas même si c\\'était le moins cher du quartier\\r\\n\\r\\n The apartment is as described on the pictures and was well equipped.\\r\\nMichael answered us to all questions immediatly.\\r\\nThe apartment is close to the subway station Broadway Junction from where you can get easily to the city and to JFK airport.\\r\\n Nice place to stay. Michael was there to meet my wife and I and provided everything we needed to make our stay as comfortable as possible. He was easy to reach in case I had any questions or concerns. Would definitely consider staying there again when we\\'re in town. We felt extremely well welcomed! He was there when we arrived and got us settled wonderfully with everything we needed. Michael was super helpful and allowed us to book super last minute. He was very accommodating and friendly. The host was ready to welcome us even though we were a little late. The space was a little cold by every effort was made to make us comfortable! Wifi worked great! Good location near a deli for food! Great place. Great host. 5 stars I felt just at home here. I like to visit often. Great experience. Great location - less than an 8 minute walk to the A train that takes you into the city. Local shop nearby that sells snacks, hot food and has an ATM (it charges tho). It was a bit dirty but nothing that couldn\\'t be handled in 2 minutes. Great space for me and my partner ^_^ Had a good time. No major problems, other than the weather (which we couldn\\'t control, although we tried). Very kind, let me stay an extra night to take my time leaving. Michael was a great host. He was very attentive and the listing description was accurate. The property was clean and accessible.  It was very cozy my boyfriend and I original booked for one night but loved it so much that we decided to book for two more nights. Perfect for two people. Near great transportation and the Wi-Fi was fast and great. Michael was attentive and made sure you were at home. He also made check-in and check-out very simple - despite how late into the night I checked in.  Wife: Host was very friendly and accomidating. He did not rush us out nor did he rush us to check in. Room was private, clean, comfy. Shower had a great flow. I had a great night sleep in that bed. Due to not being rushed out I was able to take a shower and take my time getting dress. We would definitely love he\\'s business again.  For the price, it was a great place to stay! The neighborhood felt a little unsafe at first, but nothing of note happened while we were there. The apartment was small but clean, and the bed was very clean and comfortable. The back door was convenient for ventilation, but the back area was hilariously sketchy. If you\\'re on a budget but still want an entire apartment as a home base, definitely rent from Michael! He is always available, very flexible, and will make sure your stay is as comfortable as it can be! Michael explained the whole room and was great.  Close to the metro, and everything we needed. Some neighbors were noisy during the night but that\\'s all. Thank You!! Michael is a very hospitable and friendly host and the apartment is accurate to his pictures. We had a great stay! Michael was very flexible and kind.  He met me with the keys even though it was a holiday and I arrived later than expected.  He made sure to show how everything worked and made himself available when ever I might need him.  I felt at home immediately.  The neighborhood was generally quiet and everyone was very friendly.  It was extremely close to the subway and train which was fantastic for getting around and enjoying the city.  I really enjoyed my time there. Michael was super accommodating and helpful regarding our travel plans. The accommodations are minimal but convenient to subway/LIRR/JFK.  He went out of his way and allowed us to stow our luggage in another location while we trekked around the city before departing. We look forward to staying again!\\r\\n Michael was nice and friendly host. His apartment is nothing fancy but it is ideal for budget travellers who want to have private accomodation in Brooklyn. It is very close to public transport and has very comfortable bed.  The house was just as described and everything went smoothly. Neighborhood seemed a little sketchy but we were just fine. Very close to the train and the Wi-Fi, bed, and tv were all fine. Great for people on a budget.  My visit was decent, loud neighbors but comfortable bed. The neighborhood though, is a little sketchy.  Michael was a great host.\\r\\nThe flat is ideally located between JFK and Manhattan. There are several subway lines available and the station is very close by foot.\\r\\nthe room is basic, we tend to hear the neighbours but it\\'s a good option if like us you\\'re only staying in the flat to sleep and shower.  Michael was helpful and friendly and made me feel welcome. The listing was accurate. Michael was very welcoming and friendly. Even though we didn\\'t see him but he always responded promptly. \\r\\nThe apartment was clean. Unfortunately we saw a mice there and because my wife is very much afraid of mice we immediately left the apartment. \\r\\nNeighborhood was not bad. The neighbors were very noisy.  Subway station was about 2 minutes walking distance.  Michael, fue muy atento y servicial. Michael was really amazing! The moment we got to the listing. We were a little nervous because we were two young girls from the country in NC. So a big city was pretty intimidating. Michael was super welcoming and made sure that we knew we would be safe and taken care of. He allowed us to text him and call in if we had any issues or problems and he was so willing to answer and take time to help us. We stayed for two nights and even though it was deep into Brooklyn. We had a blast. The room looked exactly like the listing. We really liked the computer he has in the room. It was useful for looking up things to do in NYC. The place was clean and the neighbors were a little loud but we expected that from NYC. As two young girls trying to take over the city, Michael made it effortless and we would stay with him again. He was super sweet and caring. For the price and Michael, this place is a complete deal. You will not regret it.  Michael was there to let me in when I arrived. Apartment is v basic, but as described. Great internet connection. I enjoyed my stay at this place. Its got the essentials like the internet, kitchen, and bathroom. I think because I stayed in so many places, I personally don\\'t mind the location and the state of the place (it\\'s not a hotel!). Highly recommended if you need somewhere to stay for a night to relax before you go somewhere else next. The place was clean and homey. The host was very receptive and reliable.  We came in late and he was outside waiting for us to let us in. I would definitely recommend this place. Michael was a great host!! Very accommodating!!! Made me feel very welcomed and secured. The listing is exactly as described.The place was perfect for an adventure in Brooklyn. It is walking distance from the Broadway Junction which takes you to JFK, Manhattan, Brooklyn Bridge and connections to Queens and the Bronx, I mean basically wherever I wanted to go. The place is clean and perfect for a single person or couple. A roomy bedroom, kitchen and bathroom for that price, you just cant beat it. The bed was  comfortable. He offers towels, blankets, sheets, cups and pots for cooking. The apartment comes with a tv and internet. Wifi is fantastic and the air conditioning was  perfect for hot Brooklyn Days. I was able to really experience the feel of Brooklyn. Safe neighborhood, cool and protective neighbors and walking distance from beautiful Brooklyn murals of Spike Lee, Questlove, and Mos Def. I ended up needing to stay an extra night and Michael booked me without hesitation.  Overall I had a great time, felt safe and will definitely stay again. 何と言っても値段が安いです｡駅は近いですが､夜間は警戒が必要です｡ﾎｽﾄのﾏｲｹﾙはﾁｪｯｸｲﾝも飛行機が遅れたにもかかわらず快く待っていてくれてｽﾑｰｽﾞな対応でした｡ Great host as always very welcoming and hepful Michael was quick with responses and action. When we were unclear with communication of check in, Michael did his best to adjust to our schedules and helped our move go smoothly. Though the place is small, the things Michael provided (essentials and wifi) made up for it.  Good place to stay for that short time - everything worked out just fine. TY I booked Michaels place for one night.  The problem was it was on a Weekend and the subay right next to the apartment was not working so it was a bit complicated to go somewhere. We decidet to stay in the apartment to drink something and order pizza. There was a grocery store right next to the apartment but no restaurant or something where we could get something to eat. (Hidden by Airbnb) maps said the next restaurant is 1h walking away. We tryed to order pizza or so but they said the don\\'t deliver there where we live.  So we searched something and after 30 min walking we found a pizza place and more 10 min we found a chines place. When you do that in the night maybe it\\'s better to to that not alone.. Didn\\'t looked soo save around there. But i think during the week it\\'s super bice to sleep there. As i said, it\\'s right next to a subway so you can reach everything very easy. The apartment is old but it have a TV with internet connection, you have free wifi and a air conditioner! That was awsome because it was soo freaky hot outside. The smell was ok after you sprayes the room spay because ther live a dog in the house upstairs and you can smell him everywhere. But all in all we had a very nice weekend there. And michael was really nice! We called him and said that we are there soon so he gave us the keys and showed us everything in the aparment (how it works,..). That was nice. Room was just as advertised.. Simple, yet effective. I arrived with my wife and two boys and was able to get in the house at 6am. Room was perfect . About 3 minutes to subway for the L train and 2 minutes from the long Island Railroad stop. Thanks for the great experience! The apartment was as promised and had some nice features, towls, computer, dishes. Its is very close to a major MTA train station which is nice. The neighborhood however is not for the faint of heart. Gentrification has not reached this part of Brooklyn and may not for some time, so if your looking for some hipster haven, go else where. \\nMore about the apt.; it does have vermin, and lots of them. the place was filled with dozen of moth balls which were used to drive of mice and rats which Michael told me could come in from the nasty storage space just off the bedroom. There were also many roaches, caught a huge one in a glass before I left. \\nAll in all, the place was worth the price and Michael was very nice. Good for a one night stay Cozy, comfortable space. Mike was very friendly. Friend and I had a nice time overall Annonce mensongère, appartement insalubre, présence de cafard, forte odeur de solvant persistante malgré une aération quotidienne.. La vaisselle était sale des notre arrivée, les draps salle ainsi que le linge de toilette et je ne vous parle pas du quartier ou l\\'on peut croiser un homme en sang venant de se faire poignarder à quelques pas de l\\'entrée du bâtiment.. \\r\\nDurant notre absence il y a de forte chance que quelqu\\'un soit rentrer dans l\\'appartement, aucune de nos affaires n\\'a été touché mais nous avons trouvé l\\'ordinateur allumé.\\r\\nDes zonard dans la cage d\\'escalier le soir qui se bourre la gueulle. \\r\\nSeule point positif, l\\'accès internet et la proximité du métro. Cependant comptez plus 40 min que 20 min pour atteindre Manhattan.  it is not the nicest nbhoods. but there are 3 supermarkets within 5 mins reach with ATM service. theres a 24/7 you walk by every time you come from the sub-\\r\\nthe building is nice like a lot in the nbhood and the nbs we met were always very nice :D\\r\\nthe apt is not the nicest. we were missing a coffee maker but thats NYC - you get a coffee to go. its good for a sleep ( be aware the bed is comfy but noisey lol)\\r\\nmichael is a great host who even picked us up after our internet went down and we were lost\\r\\nthe only very bad thing about the apt is the smell - you spray when you come in and then forget about it. but you will bring it home! beside the VERY BAD SMELL its a great stay Exactly as expected! Not the most spacious or in the best neighborhood, but was perfect for two for a weekend.  He was friendly and very informative and attentive  Micheal is a gracious host,  and the room/apt is cozy and with useful amenities.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood value overall for a spot in Brooklyn. Everything went smoothly, and the stay was more pleasant than expected as everything was clean and we had all the amenities we needed. We came as a group of 4 and was able to make space to stay and sleep comfortably. It was cool We did not expect much for the price that we paid. The place is enough for two people. There is a very strong smell from cleaning products. The neighborhood was a bit scary, wouldn\\'t recommend walking alone at night. To get to manhattan is about 30-40 min by subway. Overall it was ok, especially if you are not very fussy:)) Michael\\'s place had all the basics, with solid Internet, a baseboard heater you can adjust, and complimentary blood-bank flip-flops. The Atlantic stop on the L line seems to be closest.\\n Michael was very friendly, check in and check out were uncomplicated. The appartement is located near two subway stations, thus it is pretty easy discovering New York. We´ve had a great time. Close to the Subway station, the description is very accurate. Everything was uncomplicated L\\'appartement est très bien situé, proche de deux stations de métro allant toutes deux à Manhattan. Le logement est propre et bien équipé, idéal pour un couple. Le voisinage et Michael sont très aimables et arrangeants. Nous avons passé un séjour de 18 jours très agréable It was great. Convenient accommodation. Great host. Communication was excellent.  Michael\\'s place is cozy and comfortable. The location is very close to L train and there is a 24 hour grocery store nearby. No need to get scared of reaching home late night as the neighborhood is safe and secure. Michael would effectively communicate with you regarding any issues and he even helped us with our baggage problem on the last minute. Don\\'t miss to stay in this excellent place hosted by gem of a kind person when you visit Brooklyn. Small but comfortable, fresh towels and good wifi! Not the best neighborhood but it was suitable  La ubicación es buena pues está cerca del metro L, con la que se puede llegar a Manhattan en media hora, pero no es tan segura y agradable como esperábamos. La limpieza del lugar fue aceptable, pero no más que eso. Algo que no nos agradó fue que por las noches se filtraba humo de cigarrillo y marihuana que fumaban los vecinos a través de la calefacción. Sin embargo, todo lo demás es adecuado y como lo describe el anuncio. The place was as described, a lot cleaner than we expected and more space than most apartments in NY Michael is a great host, he let us check in early and check out at a later time. The place has everything you need, the location is convenient, the subway station is walking distance. However, the neighbors are loud at night and we had trouble accessing hot water in the morning.

It\\'s got what you need. All I require is a bed and a bathroom. It had both. Would love to stay with again if in the area. Price was better than any hotel as well. \\n\\nThanks for letting this road warrior lay his head down for a few zzzzzzzzzz Close to the train station  Not the cleanest but not very private  Bang for your buck Worth every penny! Great value Great value for money, and only a few minutes walk from the subway. Cute place, very private and comfortable. Micheal is nice and you can tell cares about his guests.  Check in time was delayed which was a problem coming from out of state. We planned to arrive at 11 after that was what Michael told us. We were told to arrive at 2:30 he didn\\'t show up until 3 then had to clean the apartment until 3:30. Comfortable small apartment, great value. The neighborhood seems sketchy at first but everyone kinda minds their own business. The subway is very close and it\\'s about a 30 min ride to Manhattan, you can go anywhere fro\\nm the L by connecting to other trains. All together it was a nice stay.  Perfect place to stay  La casa de Michael es de facil acceso desde el subway. El vecindario es recidencial.  Es acorde a su descripción. Es un lugar cómodo y económico.  This place is super inexpensive and was perfect for us. Me and my boyfriend stayed and didn\\'t mind it at all. The place was clean, plenty of space for you and another, and was very cheap so it saved us a ton of money to spend in the city! As long as you don\\'t mind a short walk to the subway, then you are good. We had to plan our showers though, as the building shares one water heater but that wasn\\'t a big deal. The neighbors would make noise but wouldn\\'t complain if we were maki g the same amount of noise so that also wasn\\'t a bother to us. We got in later than expected for check-in but Michael worked with us and was so helpful and friendly. He has your best interest! We will be staying here again once we come back to the city! It was perfect for us. The stay was great. Michael was a great host and provided everything you could need.  Not the prettiest of places, but affordable and on a direct subway line to the city and JFK The appartment was Ok but the neighbourhood felt a bit unsafe. Not recomended to children\\n Michael was very welcoming and easy to deal with. Very nice location for someone who is comfortable with talking with all types of people, very diverse area and I liked it a lot. Super close to a train that takes you straight to manhattan and it\\'s only about a 15 minute ride. Neighbors are very friendly and helpful. Would definitely come again!  Cheap, cool place. Thanks! First off, please speak with Michael directly (don\\'t text) BEFORE you come to check in, because I texted him about my arrival time a day before and he was still late for check in, and this is Brownsville (the worst part of town) so no one wants to be standing around waiting, the linen smelled like urine but other then that I enjoyed my stay in the hood due to the private apt Michael is awesome and the place is cozy. I definitely recommend staying here for a cheap option. Michael est un hôte excellent. Il nous arranger pour notre départ en partant plus tard de l\\'appartement. Le quartier est bien le metro à coté. \\nLappartement est simple et pratique. Le lit super!!  Michael was very nice and accomodating Not a big place but stay  was good Perfect for the price! Michael is really nice and friendly. Free parking on the street. I am definitely staying there again. Great place to stay, a little confusing to get to. Good value for your money.  Place is exactly as pictured. Has everything you need for a simple overnight stay. Michael nos recibió con mucha amabilidad y cortesía, la llegada fue perfecta.  ya que con vuelo de España fue difícil de estimar la llegada y nosotros sin teléfono de EEUU, Michael nos esperó sin problemas por la noche lo que hiciera falta.  Nos mostró el funcionamiento del apartamiento (tv con muchos extras, aire acondicionado, agua, electricidad, perchero, cocina equipada, toallas limpias, baño incluso con jabones y mucho papel higiénico sin necesidad de comprarlo) y no tuvimos ningún problema durante nuestra estancia en ningún momento, todo estuvo perfecto, es tal cual como publicado y la comunicación con Michael fue perfecta. Michael es el dueño y todo el edificio le respeta. Un lugar económico en la carísima NY de privacidad total sin tener que compartir cocina/baño etc. con nadie y con muchas conexiones de transporte público al lado mismo para donde sea,- parada de metro casi al lado de la casa, con los metros L y A se llega bastante rápido a Manhattan sin tener que hacer trasbordo ninguno, incluso alli mismo hay un tren de cercanías rápido y muy cómodo a Long Island y otros lugares más lejanos, lo hemos aprovechado todo.  Muchas gracias por todo, Michael! Michaels rental was a great inexpensive place to crash for a couple days while driving around and visiting people and places in Brooklyn. It was clean, easy and not pretentious. Had everything you might need for a short stay. Quick walk from Broadway Junction or the L at Atlantic. What was good was the price wifi worked well. Host was prompt. The place is small but big enough for one person. What I didn\\'t like was the overall stale smell that hits you every time you walk in. The air conditioner is so loud it woke me up several times but worst of all there were ppl who hang out in the hallway right by the door to the apt and they smoke and the smell comes into the apartment strongly, it got so bad and strong in the apartment that I had to ask them to please stop, I didn\\'t even know if I had the right to do that but my nostrils were stuffing up.  Great stay if you want to have a cheap place to see and experience New York.\\nEasy travelling to Manhattan and a few 24hr shops closeby. Michaels place is very affordable. Michael is a very nice person! The apartment was overbooked and he organized us another apartment which was not far away from the original booked accommodation. All in all I can recommend this host for short term rentals.  Privacy was great. Great value and great host. You get a bedroom, a kitchen and a bathroom. What else could you need? Easy walk to the subway. Grocery stores and delis throughout the neighborhood. Chatty locals. An affordable stay with free Roku and wi-fi. k Not worth the money!!! Coffee stains on the bed that were new and water was leaking from the roof! The guy who let me in was also rude and kind of odd Awesome place. Thanks Michael! Excelente custo beneficio. Mala ventilación del lugar, insectos en todo el departamento.\\nLas almohadas eran muy duras al igual que la cama, que además se hunde en el medio. El marco de la puerta está rota y da la impresión que con un empujón se abrirá.\\nLos vecinos fueron amables pero por las noches todos escuchan a todos, paredes y techos muy delgados. La limpieza muy mala.\\nMichael fue muy amable y su wi-fi estupendo. La hubicacion es buena, hay un almacén cerca y el metro está a 5 minutos caminando. You get exactly what you pay for, it\\'s cheap and perfect for a short stay in the city. Public transit is easily accessible and the place has all the basic amenities you will need. Michael was a great host, good at communicating. He always checked up to see if everything was okay. It was a great stay! Very easy to find. Michael was super friendly. I would certainly use this location again. Wszystko zgodnie z opisem! Dziękujemy za pobyt! Great value but it looks like a tough neighborhood on outside but people are real nice.  Michael was nice and checked me in on time. Great house,great stay,great host Great stay for this money Micheal è stato molto disponibile dal check in al check out. Ha tenuto le nostre valigie oltre l\\'orario del check out. La casa è a 5 minuti dalla metropolitana ma di sera la strada non sembra molto sicura. La serratura della porta andrebbe cambiata e l\\'appartamento ha bisogno di una bella pulita, abbiamo trovato alcuni insetti. \\nIn conclusione il maggiore problema è la pulizia, ma se si passa la giornata fuori e considerando il prezzo e la posizione, ne vale la pena.  ﾏｲｹﾙはとても感じがよく､いいﾎｽﾄでした｡家では､同じｱﾊﾟｰﾄの住人の音楽が夜中もうるさかったです｡上の階の足音や生活音が下の階にすごく響いた｡時間帯によってｼｬﾜｰのお湯が出なくなる時があった｡天井からの水漏れがあったようで､帰宅したらﾍﾞｯﾄﾞが濡れていたが夜にも関わらずﾎｽﾄがすぐにﾁｪｯｸしに来てくれた｡駅からは近いが､慣れるまでは少し怖いと思うかも知れません｡ Great host, lock was tricky but he had a neighbour let us in the building. Key does work but is a bit difficult. Great value. Loved how it was an entire place that had all that was necessary and more. Bon emplacement pour très court séjour metro pas loin ligne A C Quiet, Serves The Purpose, Clean...Wish There Were More Food Options Around Though. Accomodation was quite good equal to price. Bed was good,water was hot. Close to subway.For few nights stay is really okej. Clean, cozy apartment. I had a great stay here and you just can\\'t beat the value. Great place for the price!! Heater was weak but enjoyed the stay Wir wollten 10 Tage in der Unterkunft bleiben und haben uns nach der 1. Nacht eine neue Unterkunft gesucht. Die Heizung war viel zu schwach und der Heizlüfter der uns empfohlen wurde schaltete sich nach 30 Minuten aus. Michael empfahl uns den Herd anzumachen für mehr Wärme. Gerade in der Nacht sind Herd und Heizlüfter keine Möglichkeiten zum Heizen. Es gab auch keine richtigen Decken so dass unsere einzige Nacht der Horror war. Die Tagesdecke sah sehr keimig aus. Das Bad konnte man gar nicht beheizen und es hatte dort nur 12 Grad. Das Bett war durchgelegen, hat nur geknarzt und auch die Küchenschränke waren teils kaputt. Wir waren froh eine neue Unterkunft beziehen zu können die wir uns vor Ort selbst gesucht haben. It\\'s livable but not a place you want to spend much time in. Bring your own sheets and some RAID for the roaches. You\\'re paying 50$ a night to stay in new york, you get what you pay for. House was amazingg Good Good place Brakowało pościeli, było zimno, ogólnie niezbyt czysto, łazienka w pełni wyposażona ale zimna, drzwi od łazienki nie domykały się, wifi, telewizor bardzo dobre. Dzwonek do drzwi nie działa. Okolica to typowy Brooklyn, nie ma rewelacji ale blisko lotniska. Worked well for what we needed! Great place for two people to go if they aren’t going to spend much time there other than resting/sleeping! Really appreciated the Free Netflix! Thanks Michael, the place was nice and warm and was easy to find and I would stay again. Relatively good place to stay but definitively not in winter because the room was very cold even though there were heaters. And it’s rather far away from Manhattan Michael was really nice and helping! The apartment is good Good price and great access to the subway! Michael made sure we had plenty of heating during this particularly cold period. Get what you pay for It Was A Nice Clean Place To Stay.. Great place, would definitely recommend. Great place and a lovely Bathroom  go there by yourself or with your shawty total privacy, for this price make your wanna stay the whole week Great for couples or being by yourself You get what you pay for. Comfortable spot, uncomfortable odor. very nice and helpful Great place. Would stay again. A suitable flat for a couple, nearby metro, bus and train connections. Michael was a friendly host. ‘‘Twas lit Hinta-laatusuhde hyvä. Metroasema lyhyen kävelymatkan päässä, joten yhteydet kaupunkiin hyvät ja helpot. Talo oli hieman äänekäs, mutta ihmiset,  joita kohdattiin olivat ystävällisiä. Aivan lähellä myös pieniä ruokakauppoja. Asunto on vanha ja monin osin kaipaisi remonttia. Ikkunat olivat peitetyt muovilla ilmeisesti vedon estämiseksi, joten ulos ei nähnyt asunnosta. Tietojemme mukaan alueella on hieman rauhaton ja levoton maine, mutta me emme kohdanneet ongelmia viiden päivän majoittumisemme aikana. Olimme tyytyväisiä. Pieni asunto vastasi meidän tarpeisiin ja oli viihtyisä. Siinä pääsi mukaan myös kaupungin tunnelmaan eri tavalla kuin ehkä hotellissa asuen. Sänky oli hyvä. Michael oli asiallinen ja joustava. Best Airbnb experience I had! Overall ok for the price if you don’t mind cigarette smell and cold water for the shower Great spot be back soon 2nd time staying here and it was great ! exactly as pictured. Netflix was nice touch . good place to rest for the night! Place was valid Great deal Great little place that\\'s close to the city with a subway station right outside. Great place Loved the neighborhood. Felt right at home. Nice place to stay for a night in the city Nice host, but the bed was too hard and cold for me because of poor isolation in the room It was a good place if you’re looking for a quick stay for one day. Place smells old and needs to be cleaned up  It’s ok for the price A++ You get what you pay for  You get what you pay for. Exactly as seen in pictures despite a few roaches here and there. Netflix was a nice touch. Place was very well air conditioned. Only down side neighborhood was very rough. Great stay It’s not too out of place. Honestly I would never sleep there, I didn’t feel comfortable with the extra guests (roaches) and the pillows or sheets didn’t look very clean. There was also a pretty bad odor in the kitchen. Could tidy up a lot more. I hope your home progresses in a great way. Great stay If you\\'re flying solo and don\\'t need a big space, this is a perfect crash pad for visit NYC for the weekend.  Decent place for budget travelers.\\n La zona no es segura, hay mala gente, no salir de noche, nos robaron. Para ir del metro al apartamento hay que pasar por un pasaje, que los propios vecinos de la zona pasaban corriendo aterrorizados. Decidimos cancelar aunque perdimos dinero antes de que pasara algo más grave. Ademas el apartamento estaba sucio, en especial el baño. Nada recomendable. Good near by train station I enjoyed my stay Micheal is a great host Value Spot you get what you pay for Very convenient location - trains to various places in NYC within a walking distance Good cheap closer subway but it\\'s not a good area. Always a pleasure  to stay some where that feels like home.  It is always peace and quiet. Reasonable house Great place to stay. Neighborhood has everything you\\'ll need and really close to a lot of different subway lines. It\\'s kind of far from Manhattan but for a price that low honestly it\\'s understandable. It\\'s a good option for someone looking to save money on their visit to NYC. location to subway was ideal.   i didnt get to enjoy that due to maintenance on track every night i was there.   but very safe neighborhood,  didnt seem but dont be mistaken.   it was safer than my hometown and i had to experience it.   very much safe n helpful, friendly ppl around.   i would definitely book again.   Felt like a local and had everything i needed.   great affordable stay.  Even when trains changed and complicated traveling,   this place was a quick walk and never had a worry. No the cleanest place if he cleans it maybe it will be a good place to spend one night Great place to stay to crash for a night or two. For under $60 I’d say this is a pretty decent place to stay in Brooklyn. The apartment was clean it just had a slight odor which wasn’t really a problem for my guest and I but it was present. It was close to a few deli’s which came in handy for midnight snacks. The train is also close by if you’re looking to explore New York. Micheal is nice and arranging but the neighborhood is not really reassuring. One window is broken and there is a curtain to plug the hole. The last night of our stay we had to kill a cockroach and there are barely enough plates and cutlery for two people (half of it is plastic). There is a light in the kitchen that you can\\'t switch off, unless you unscrew the light bulb (there is obviously no door between the room and the kitchen). The place is quite dirty (mold and dust) and doors are hard to open/close. The only good point is the closeness to the metro station which takes you to upper manhattan in around 40 minutes. I had a great time in Michaels apartment! The value for the price is definitely unbeatable. So much worth it. Easy access, private and fairly quiet for New York City. It is not of course the top luxurious apartment, but there is more than all you need for a good quality stay. It was exactly what I was looking for. \\n\\nMichael was very responsive and helpful at all times on the telephone. \\n  \\nI read some previous negative reviews and I can say that for my experience, the smell was good (I didn\\'t smell cigarettes at all), and I didn\\'t see any cockroach the entire week. \\n\\nThank you again Michael and I would definitely come back! :-) It is a no frills stay with a comfortable bed,  wifi, and a TV in the room I was in which also locks. I just needed to crash so my requirements weren\\'t many. Michael was responsive and flexible. So, this place is a steal.  It’s nothing fancy, but why would you need fancy when you’re close to a metro that will take you anywhere in NYC?!?  Well worth your dollar and very easy communication with Michael.  Everything that i needed was already here (towels, shower stuff, cooking equipment, etc.) The good cheap place if you need somewhere to sleep. Close to subway. Great Host It\\'s cool, host didn\\'t hover. great for the price! it’s a perfect place to sleep after a night in the city, check in and check out was easy the place was extremely lackluster. there was no heat. we asked for heat.and there was never a response in that regard. I never got back to this place ever again. Highly Recommended! Jeannie was a great host! She is very communicative and understanding. The home was comfy and clean. Jeannie\\'s place was absolutely perfect - great location, comfortable and clean. It was very easy to communicate and check-in. We loved how close her apartment was to the museums and Central Park. There is a lot to do and see within walking distance of her place, so definitely worth the value. It was nice to have a full kitchen and the shower pressure and heat were wonderful (simple things when it\\'s FREEZING outside, right?). Jeannie, thank you so much! Jeannie was fantastic and always available if we had questions or concerns. Would definitely stay again. Be sure to confirm ALL facts re: apt (ie listed amenities, exact location, etc) prior to checking in.  That said, the apt and the neighborhood were both nice and a good quality for the price (aside from the lack of functional television)  Also, Jeannie was very friendly and easy to deal with, as well as very accommodating as far as our last minute booking and off-hour check-in time following a Broadway play. Had a great stay at this place! Fantastic hot shower, super clean and comfortable. \\nGood place to spend the night missing some details of kitchen equipment that can be improved and were already suggested. Also make clear the arrival instructions to avoid last-minute changes that being on the trip is preferable to avoid Cute NYC Apt., great location and wonderful hostess. Jeannie made us feal like we were at home.  Great location, great price and great host ! Pros: SO CLEAN. Excellent location. Good food nearby. \\n\\nCon (only one): The apartment listed in this post is not the apartment I was sent to. In fact, the only photo that belongs to the apartment I was sent to, is the couch/table photo. \\n\\nEven despite the location issue, I would stay here again. It\\'s not far off from where the itinerary had their location listed, and it includes all of the amenities that are on this page. The check in/check out process was a lot easier than I thought it would be, given the fact that it is New York. Overall a great experience. Please note that the photos listed and address provided for this apartment are not accurate. We had multiple complaints of cleanliness problems, and the bed and sofa/futon bed are unfortunately quite uncomfortable (we were unable to stay both nights). Jeannie was, however, quite responsive to our complaints and quickly arranged to have one night reimbursed to us. Really clean and cozy place, close to lots of restaurants and a short walk from the East River, which was great! Great and prompt communication with Jenny! Great location. Close to the subway station and easy to get to other places in the city from here. Very clean and comfortable apartment! This place was like a fancy hotel room. Great comfortable bed in the bedroom with a futon in the living room, clean bathroom and kitchen. I can’t picture staying anywhere else every time I come t NYC. This is a small and clean apartment on a quiet street in the Upper East Side. It is close to several subway lines as well as a cross town bus to the Upper West Side. One pleasant surprise was the farmers market right across the street on Saturday morning.\\nAs one would expect in Manhattan the apartment is smaller than one bedroom apartments in other US cities. We were three people, two parents and one daughter, and the apartment was manageable but tight for us. The kitchen and living room are the same room, with no kitchen table or chairs. The bedroom is separated from the living room with a sliding door with windows. The two beds were separated by about twelve inches. So it definitely works for three people but not if they need privacy or have different sleep schedules. The kitchen is sparsely furnished with limited cookware. \\nThe photos in the listing are of a different apartment of the same size and basic pattern. We have encouraged the host to produce a separate listing for each apartment she rents. Jenny was accommodating, however, the apartment we stayed in was different than what was advertised online.  The real unit is about a block or so away. There is one bed (not the greatest) and one futon (also not the greatest). There was no garbage can, and not enough utensils to cook a proper meal in the kitchen.\\n\\nWe were surprised that we had to wait in a nearby pizza restaurant until the landlords went back inside - I guess we weren\\'t supposed to be renting for the night/weekend? Great spot and location. Highly recommended I loved how Jenny’s place was very close to subway entrances. It made it very easy to get to many places. The place was quiet and the bed was very comfortable. Jenny was quick to respond to our reservation request &  the questions we had.  This apartment was not what we originally contracted so we had no idea what we were getting.  Paid parking was down the block. It was not as \\'free & available\\'  as we were led to believe. Also, we were told there would be breakfast, but there was not.   We needed to leave a day early due to a death in our family   We were not reimbursed for the 1 day, despite our request and all the changes made. We had a lovely stay at Jenny’s apartment. It was the perfect size for two people for just a short stay in the city. The apartment was very clean and we were provided with bedding, towels, and kitchenware to use during our visit. Only complaint was that the pictures were not completely accurate. The kitchen and the bedroom in the picture are not the kitchen and bedroom in the apartment we stayed in. Other than that Jenny was very good at communicating and made our stay great! The place was very cute and clean, and the location was perfect. The photos are NOT the same as the apartment we were directed to, buy they are very similar. There were a few teas and oatmeal packets, etc. available. The fridge smelled a little weird, and the hall of the apartment building smelled bad, but everything else was perfect! Great location, and easy check-in. Thanks Jenny! El departento de Jenny esta muy bien ubicado, cerca del subte lo q permite un acceso rápido a Times Square. Muy limpio. El barrio se siente muy seguro, nosotros llegabamos tarde y nos sentiamos comodos andando. Muchos lugares para comer por la zona. Detalle no menor, muy buena presion de agua en la ducha. Definitivamente volveriamos a quedarnos. Great location, clean NY apartment in a safe neighborhood. Close to subways and museums. Jenny was responsive to my questions. Very convenient location. Jenny replies quick to your messages and is really helpful. The photos are outdated. The photo of the bedroom is 100% not the bedroom that we stayed in. The apartment is tiny. There is inconsistency in communication. The water temperature in the shower fluctuated with the tiniest touch. The location is perfect though. The woman who met us with the keys to the apartment after finding the keys were not placed in the pick up location was not the woman in the photos posted on air Bnb. It felt like I was communicating with a false person. Great place, very clean and nice. Really good location. Jenny was very nice and responsive. Super clean. Nicely kept together and a great place with all the essential amenities, including a kitchen with stove. Perfect for two people wanting to explore NY. Jenny à etait au top on a pu accéder au airbnb plutot que prévu elle a été fort sympathique elle nous à même apporter en plus de sa des collations concernant l’appartement l’emplacement était top le lit confortable il faisait une bonne température dedans donc très agréable je recommande Great time!  Will stay here again next time when were in the city Nice location, subway/shops/restaurants within easy reach.\\nVery comfortable bed. Jenny quickly responded to my all questions! The unit is ideally placed in the city- close to the Q and walking distance to the Met and Central Park. The check in and check out process was easy- only required dropping the keys! Prima slaapplaats met een schone badkamer in een rustige straat in een hele leuke buurt Good location. Jeannie is very responsive. The flat is very close to the street and to the entrance so there\\'s noise. Great for a quick trip in and out of city. Quaint and cozy! The apartment was very clean when we arrived, and is a few minutes by foot to the nearest subway stop. The space was quiet for being located in the middle of a major city. We visited on some particularly warm days, and the space was quite warm at night,  but Jenny quickly responded by bringing us a fan, which made a huge difference. She was always responsive and check-in was easy. We would recommend staying with her in the future. We really appreciated Jenny coming right over when I lost the keys, and everything in the apartment worked just fine, the only issue we had is that there was only one coffee mug, so you might want to add another. Otherwise, perfect location, great experience of NYC right in the heart of midtown Manhattan, walking distance to the Met and Central Park and many many restaurants. A real NYC neighborhood experience! Amazing place Clean and updated, but it needs a lot to merit the amount charged versus value received.  Not great privacy (it\\'s street level, and loud if the windows are open) , no ventilation, and no added comfort as far as furnishings go. A double bed, a small low futon and a coffee table are the only furniture in the apartment.  The front window is covered by a bedspread thrown over a tension rod, and there are gaps in the coverage.   Not good for three adults; maybe two adults and a child on the futon.  I cannot give it a recommendation in good conscience at this time, based on our experience.\\nWith some attention to comfort (rugs, shelves near the bed for necessities, reading lamps, etc)  and the addition of air conditioning, this could be a decent place for two and a child. Very quiet apartment on the UES. The apartment is stylish and cozy and just what we needed for our stay. We spent every morning walking a couple blocks to the famous H&H Bagels then to Central Park for a nice breakfast picnic. Close to supermarkets that opens 24hours. Jenny was very easy to work with and responded to all my messages quickly. Check in and check out were super easy. We loved the apartment and the location in the Upper East Side. I highly recommend staying here! Die Lage der Wohnung ist Klasse. Subway ist zu Fuss gut erreichbar. Die Wohnung hatte leider keine Klimaanlage und es war fast unerträglich heiss und schwül (Aussentemperatur nachts z.T. bis zu 30 Grad). Die Küche war eher spärlich eingerichtet und es gab keinen Esstisch, sondern nur ein kleines Sofa mit  Couchtisch, an dem man nicht gut essen kann. Das Badezimmer war sauber. Der Kleiderschrank war z.T. mit persönlichen Gegenständen bestückt und bot wenig Platz zur Kleiderablage. Location can\\'t be beat for the value. Wonderful upper east side location just minutes walk to museums, 2 major subway stations, Central Park and the East River. The appartment modern and cozy. Having just lived a year in a tiny house it was luxurious. Check in and out was easy and communication was good.  I will definitely check availability next trip! great Great place, well located and comfortable. Jenny is a  very good, responsive and flexible host! Great apartment in a great spot. The apartment has a wonderful location in the Upper East Side and great value. It was easy to find the keys and was a simple but great place to stay for my work trip. Michelle was super responsive and communicative. Would recommend! Good location  The flat is a modern and renovated one-room apartment. Its location is pretty convenient, very close to the subway (line 4,5,6 and Q) with direct connection to Times Square. The area is safe and with many supermarkets and restaurants. The general cleaning and the essentials (towels and sheets) were the painful point, but the communication with the host was good and she was responsive and efficient. In detail, the flat is equipped with a double bed and a futon couch that can be used as second bed. The futon is quite short and it has a metal junction in the middle, therefore it is not very comfortable. The bed sheets provided were dirty and the amount of towels was not enough for the number of guests and days. There is a kitchen, dirty as well, and there is no table for eating, only a tiny coffee table is placed in front of the couch. The kitchen equipment is very limited (and dirty), but there is an useful microwave. The bathroom with bathtub was very dirty and without ventilation, we tried to open the window but we were not able (too old, too dirty and just opposite to the neighbors\\' window, therefore they could see us showering). On the other hand, as soon as we told to the host our problems and criticisms she replied immediately and she cleaned the bathroom and provided us clean towels. Host is great communicator, however, will will look elsewhere when we are in NYC next. We did not find the apartment clean or comfortable.  Muy buena ubicación, muy cómodo y sumamente recomendable. Appartement globalement bien situé mais pas à l\\'adresse indiquée en premier lieu! Clé à récupérer au pied d\\'un arbre à 400 mètres de là. Une tonne d\\'indications pour ne pas parler aux voisins et leur indiquer notre destination.... It\\'s small, but you have everything you need. All kitchen fittings are modern, a good firm bed and it\\'s quiet. Bayards Ale house nearby is a friendly local with good food. Great location, we easily found free street parking, went on bike rides in Central Park and across the Brooklyn bridge. Enjoyed the restaurants and nearby Starbucks. Great place, clean and close by everything. Very responsive to messages The host canceled this reservation 28 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Nice location! Bonjour,\\n\\nJe ne conseille pas cet appartement a part pour l’emplacement car proche du métro, de Times Square, Central Park. Pour le reste il est préférable pour le même prix voire moins cher de louer un hôtel. Tout d’abord l’adresse n’est pas celle indiquée sur le site. L’hôte ne vous préviens que 24h qu’il faut aller récupérer les clés à un endroit, puis aller à une autre adresse différente. Ensuite elle vous dit que si les voisins vous posent des questions il ne faut pas mentionner airbnb, que vous venez voir une amie appelé Roxanna idem si des inspecteurs passent. Tout ça n’est pas clair et donc pas rassurant surtout quand on vient d’un autre pays. Le frigo est vide, pareil pour les placards il n’y a rien pour prendre le petit déjeuner à part le café mais même pas un sachet de sucre ou de couverts. Le ménage n’est fait qu’en surface, toute la saleté est caché sous le lit, on comprend pourquoi il y a des cafards. Il fait hyper chaud il n’y a pas d’air la nuit on a l’impression de suffoquer les nuits sont longues. Le canapé est usé on s’enfonce dedans, le lit n’est fait que pour une personne. Il n’y a que petite table basse pour essayer de manger. L’appartement est face à une école donc beaucoup de bruits, le parquet grince de quoi réveiller tout l’immeuble et le sol n’est pas droit. On entend la chasse d’eau des voisins, on les entend rentrer et sortir de chez eux et on entend les personnes qui parlent dehors. Bref énormément de désagréments nous avons été très très déçu, l’appartement n’est pas à la hauteur de ce que l’offre met en avant et trop cher pour ce qu’il propose autant dire rien. Je suis dur mais pour une première fois que je réserve un airbnb je regrette ne pas avoir payé plus cher pour un hôtel. Our stay was good. It is a first floor apartment so being in the city and on the ground level you do hear quite a bit of noise, but not to the fault of the host. Perfect for one or two nights. Great host. The place is confortable and near the subway Bien en général pour le prix, l’équivalent d’une chambre d’hôtel côté grandeur, pas de table de cuisine si vous compter y déjeuner, ne laissez pas de nourriture traîner, j’ai aussi eu la visite de cafard...mais c’est aussi ça NY....J’y retournerais tout même Great location, great place. This place needs  a lot of attention to the basics, like painting the walls, installing the AC properly, redo the shower area, because it is so old, that it looks grimy even after being cleaned. The kitchen was in better shape, but missing the basics, like cups, bowls, silverware, cutting knife and kitchen towels. There was only one dirty pan to cook with, a very small pot and a dirty pot with a broken handle. Overall a very loveless place, no effort put into making it nice for the guest. I would never book this place again  and can\\'t recommend it. Small typical NY apartment in a great UES location. Perfect for one or two people who don’t plan on spending a lot of time in the apartment. la première adresse donnée n\\'est pas la bonne. \\nil ne faut pas mentionner qu\\'on vient par air bnb \\ncela dit le logement est bien situé. . Very nice location! Easy access and clean! I would stay here again! Thank you! Great spot. Good location and a good size for a couple who want to be out all the time. Unfortunately we didn’t feel the flat was very clean and will not be booking this apartment again. Michelle was very easy to communicate with and did kindly come and change the sheets on our request. Nice place to stay if your visiting NYC for a long weekend Had a great stay at Suzy\\'s hostel-like apartment. Quiet and in a really convenient and interesting part of the city. Located close to great restaurants and corner shops, I\\'d definitely recommend it to travellers on a budget. I should note our room was very echoey and didn\\'t have any windows, but the aircon was great and we slept soundly.  Great room!! The beds were comfy, perfect for my tourmates and I. The space was big, it was like a hostel style situation. Very nice place! Has a hostel vibe. Clean and spacious. It\\'s a big apartment with a lot of rooms, so you will share with other from airbnb. For the price, it was what we expected :) Great that we got towels and linen!  This place is really good for people who are on a budget but still wish to have a high quality stay. The rooms are clean, comfortable and not dim at all! (I hate rooms that are too dim) There are no windows in the room, in case someone concerns about that. The bathrooms and kitchen are good too. The location of this place is not near to the tourist spots, but that\\'s why the place isn\\'t noisy. For people who don\\'t drive, there are two metro stations with 5-15min walk from the place, which is quite convenient. Overall, a nice place with a good price. Y\\'know those scary stories you\\'ve heard/experienced (because i have before this) with bad Airbnb hosts that don\\'t communicate well & suck all around. NOT Suzy at all, she was an amazing host. also the restaurants around were delicious.  The neighborhood is really nice. 10min walk to subway station. Worth the price. Great place! Feels like staying in a hotel, not someone\\'s house.  We had a great time staying at Suzy\\'s place. She was very attentive to our needs as guests. Reaching out to her was never a problem and any questions we had...she had the answer to right away.   The place was cozy and clean. Close to the M train to get into Manhattan.\\nSuzy was a great host overall.\\n\\n\\n\\n Fantastic! Though it was a short stay, it was pretty sweet.\\nOne regret is that finding parking spot is tough and not closer to public parking garages. But other wise, it had been splendid. I m not satisfied with theses rooms The room is clean, close subway station, Suzy is a very nice person, thank you for your help.  A really nice place to stay. Location is as mentioned, not too far from Manhattan. Cleanliness is always maintained and you will find everything you need. Recommended.  Susy\\'s place was very clean , the shower had hot water, the room was clean and nice, the beds felt really well, also the room has a heater and air conditioner, definitely an excellent apartment to stay in NYC. Thanks Suzy :) we will be back soon If you\\'re looking for a place to sleep, then this place is perfect. Relatively well priced, and close to the train.  The outside of the place is a bit sketchy, as well as when you enter. But once you pass the kitchen the place is updated and modern. The rooms are beautiful and well kept . Very spacious with high ceilings. Only thing Is, Suzy was downstairs cleaning with 2 other girls, I waved hello, and she gave me the fakest smile along with an eye roll. Other than that the place was great and I enjoyed my stay! Good for a stay for 1 day Clean room. Kitchen space with table for work. Just that you share the space with many other rooms. It was great to stay in this house. It\\'s not to far from CBD and it\\'s easy to find if you follow host\\'s message. there are many grocery shops near house. Sharing Kitchen and bathroom are also clean.  Chambre qui nous a pleinement satisfaite, nous étions 4.  Great budget place to stay if you need somewhere to sleep and/or store stuff while you do things. Super clean! Exactly like the photos! A good amount of privacy. Very cozy! The room looked exactly as pictured and we found it to be really simple checking in and out. The bathrooms are shared among multiple units so plan to wake up early or you\\'ll end up waiting around for at least a little while. Overall though, it was a great value and I would stay again. This was awesome! When first arriving the neighborhood sketched me out a bit but right outside the apartment it\\'s totally fine. Suzy is very kind and helpful with all questions you may have. The room was very clean and beds were amazing. It was super helpful having two bathrooms with three showers total. One downfall with staying Saturday Sunday was the M line was down and we weren\\'t notified ahead of time. (We figured it out with ease) Great place to stay and will stay again!  Me and my friends had a nice stay at Suzy\\'s place. The rooms were clean, the appartment was close to a subway station and the neighborhood was nice. Only disadvantage is that the walls are kinda thin  and we slept next to a family with a baby but other than that we had a very nice stay A very convenient area. Had to stay the night last minute. Everything I need for family was a 10 min walk away. host totally not responsive. very late replies. misleading information in the messages. delayed answers from the host. didn\\'t respond after dozens of message sent. horrible experience. very unfriendly to adjustments. extremely inflexible to the requests.  Suzy\\'s place was really great. The beds were comfortable and the place was generally very clean and tidy. The neighborhood seems sketchy at first but is actually quite a cool place. Initially, we had trouble trying to get the AC to work because the water hadn\\'t been drained. But we eventually managed to work it out and it was working well for the duration of our stay. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who\\'s on a budget.  The room is tiny and claustrophobic in a hallwayway of many other rooms. Wouldn\\'t feel safe leaving my things here. would reccomend somewhere else at this price.  Ce logement ressemble plus à une auberge de jeunesse qu\\'à un logement Airbnb mais efficace pour le prix.  i highly recommend staying in Suzy apartment, really nice bon rapport qualité prix. Great communication, great price. Great for the price. 价格是挺便宜,但是晚上噪音太大,完全不隔音,床上用品太脏,睡着身上会痒 The place was really nice, it was close to 2 subway stations and 15 min to Manhattan. Safe, clean and close to centre of city. We spend nice 3 days there. This place great, it has all the essentials and is a short walk from the subway. The beds are very comfortable and the communal areas were kept clean. We only stayed for the night but it was a great stop off on our travels, would recommend. Great place, recommended if you\\'re ok sharing bathrooms and others living on the same floor as you. There were no windows in our room, A/C was too loud, but everything for really good price  \\nSuzy is very nice and she answer very fast. There is a one bathroom for around 9 rooms each available for 4 guests. This makes waiting line for bathroom around 30 minutes.\\nThe bathroom is too dirty. The toilet flush doesn\\'t work properly. The trash bin is full.\\nThere is a lot of noise. Since it\\'s a shared area for a lot of guests this makes the place noisy and impossible to sleep at.\\nNone of us could sleep for whole night also the floor was damage and by walking on it, it makes an awful noise specially infront of room #6. Make it even harder to sleep.\\nAlso there were many bugs on the floor in the room.\\nTerrible exprience although this isn\\'t our first exprience with airbnb. 1. No windows\\n2. Super noisy AC\\n3. Crappy floor that makes so much noise over the night that you can\\'t sleep\\n4. Around 10 rooms, it\\'s more like backpacking bed. \\n5. 1 functional toilet on these 10 rooms. \\n\\nBottom line: If I could go back in past, I wouldn\\'t stay in this accommodation. I don\\'t know how happened that this place earned 4 stars. Luckily, I stayed only 1 night and moved to another place. If I had to stay longer, I would be really angry. The floor is really loud. You can hear people walking on the hall as if they are in your room. You can also hear anybody who is on the hallway as the walls are thin. I don\\'t know why but there were ants everywhere which is a bit disturbing. There are only 2 bathrooms for like 6 rooms each of them with 4 people so you have to wait somethimes. It is 12-13 minutes away fron the subway. It is a cheap place and you get cheap conditiones. I would recomend paying 10-20 bucks a night more and have a better place. This flat offers somewhere to rest your head and basic amenities. Perfect for those who are out exploring New York all day. With a 10 minute walk to the subway, it\\'s really easy to get into Manhattan on the L line. The kitchen offers all you need to prepare and cook food. With 8/9 bedrooms and only 2 bathrooms, there may be the odd queue for the bathroom and as expected, it gets dirty quite quickly. With the amount of bedrooms, this should be advertised as a hostel rather than airbnb.  I would recommend checking that you haven\\'t got a room without a window (!) which we did - this obviously made it very stuffy. We had air con in our room but we found this to be very loud making it difficult to sleep. Suzy was a nice host, quick to respond and happy for us to leave our bags before check-in and after check-out which was really handy. The code on the door made it easy to get in and out as needed. This is perfect.Clean bedrooms, (Website hidden by Airbnb) is cheap and easy to find with (Hidden by Airbnb) maps.A good place for students and people who love to travel and also want to save some money. Clean, easy to go in downtown Manhattan and very good information from Suzy. However, the appartment is shared with other people  ( private bedroom but shared bathroom ), the bedroom have no window and a disturbing AC. Muy bien alojamiento cerca el metro para moverse a cualquier lado sin ningún problema muy limpio Very clean place and close to subway This space was perfect! Clean. Quiet. Lots of kitchen dishes to use and space in the fridge if needed. We never had a problem waiting for the bathrooms. We were always up early and sightseeing for the day! Was a perfect spot for us! And Suzy and her sister were great hosts! Would definetly go back again! Get place, easy, comfortable, no problems. Great value Definitely get what you pay for here .. Great for just sleeping! However, in room 6 there was a constant thudding happening throughout the night. Owner was informed and checked it out, but I don\\'t believe it was happening during the day. The sound continued through the second night. I’m frm SD Cali and visiting NYC, she makes u feel welcome after staying at her place we decided to look for another Airbnb a little more close for we’re we gonna go check out more places and it was horrible the smell, etc we decided to stay a little longer and contact Suzy for another stay as u read we definitely love her place thanks for ur hospitality Easy to check-in and our room was warm. Very good wifi connection. Suzy is a nice host. Thank you for your quick response. This place was just as pictured. Great stay. Others staying in different rooms might stay up a little later than you. Just keep this in mind if you’re a light sleeper. For me it was perfectly fine. Substations are within walking distance which is great. Didn’t take to long to get into NYC. For parking... one side of the streets get cleaned Monday and Friday and the other side gets cleaned Tuesday and Thursday or something like that. If you get there around 11-11:30 and wait till the cleaning truck passes by you’ll have somewhere to park no problem. Just look at the little signs by the road that announce the cleaning schedule. Parking fills up fast. \\nWould definitely stay here on future trips!!! Good It\\'s always a pleasure to stay at Suzy\\'s. She\\'s an excellent host! Very communicative, and accommodating. By far my favorite place to stay, and we will definitely be back again soon. I would recommend this place to because of the host, price, and cleanliness. Great place to stay at just for the night. My friends and I had no problems checking in because Suzy gave very clear instructions which I appreciated. The front of the house is somewhat sketchy but the inside is renovated and very well kept.  Great location and price for a trip to NYC. Suzy was responsive and very helpful. Highly recommend Suzy\\'s place! It was very clean, check-in was easy, and an excellent deal. . Good place to stay when visiting. No visitors allowed though Our stay with Suzy was amazing! Highly recommended. Amazing!\\n\\nAlthough we had a fair walk to Suzy\\'s place, it was very much worth it. The room was spacious and comfortable and very clean.\\n\\nI would definitely stay again. Please keep the toilet and sink clean. Also have extra blankets Suzy was a great host. She responded to my messages quickly. When I had a concern she helped me out. There was a few things I did not like which was an odor coming from one of rented rooms before my room. The room floor was dusty and I had to sweep it. Another thing was the heat the first night I arrived it was so cold. And the water was off due to pipe fixing without being alerted before booking. Other than that I liked the relaxing stay. Everyone was quiet at a certain time at time. I had a great sleep there. No one bothers you there. Super convenient and cheap! Don’t stay there! Love this place ❤️ A very positive experience, the house is clean and well equipped. The location of the apartment is good as it is close to two subway lines. In addition it is worth mentioning the proximity of the host, which at all times is willing to solve problems or doubts that may arise during the stay. 10/10 recommend and would definitely stay again. The place is clean, but the bedroom is noisy caused by AC unit. Clean, quiet, and affordable! Something that is sometimes hard to find in NYC. Location was great and room size was perfect for four people! good place to crash in after sight seeing\\n Good enough to stay overnight but for longer stay you are usually in a queue for the washroom and kitchen The passage is also very narrow between rooms excelente departamento, mejor de lo que se ve en las fotos great place if you’re just looking to sleep in it. Clean and affordable!, just beware with the other people staying around you, you could be woken up at anytime like we were at 3:30am with people walking around/children running in the halls and making food.  This place is nice for a cheap place to stay but is sooo far from the L. It also feels as cheap as it costs. The stay wasn’t bad at all but I def wouldn’t go back. Good luck to all others xx perfect to stay a night or two, very clean and basic with everything you need to feel recharged Expect to follow guidelines especially when it comes to Check out. It’s fast and doubt any extra time will be giving. Very basic room. Exactly what we needed. If you need entertainment bring laptop or iPad. House is very clean, beds are really comfortable. It’s very flexible check in.  Very good option when you are looking for just a bed in the neighbourhood of manhattan. everything is good Great for last minute reservations.  Affordable prices with a good, comfortable stay. It was very last minute so I highly appreciate the host for having a place for my family and I to stay on such short notice. Highly recommended. unfortunately these accommodations were not close to what we had expected. we did not want luxury accommodations, but it felt more like a hostel than a typical Airbnb room Everything was as described. Perfect for few nights. A good place to stay for a couple nights. Nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. Decent flat for folks who need a clean place to spend the night. Super easy check in, ideal if your out and about in the city! Safe neighborhood and quick walk to amenities and the subway It\\'s ok to stay here The location was close to metros. We felt nice neighbours. It was clean bed room. It was a bit noisy in hallway. It is low cost to visit New york. Great location, nice apartment. Overall good place for the price and quick stay Logement très bruyant, les murs n isolent pas dutout du bruit. Il y a constamment du mouvement la nuit jusqu\\'au petit matin, en tout cas durant notre sejour. La propreté est limite. Dans nos chambres, lits doubles x2, le chauffage/clim à fait énormément de bruit toute la nuit. Malgré tout le logement est bien située dans brooklyn avec accès au métro à a peine 5 min. You definitely get what you pay for here. This is not necessarily a bad thing and it worked out fine for us since the only time we spent there was to sleep. Check in was super easy and the subway is about a 10 minute walk away, about 45 mins to get most places in Manhattan. Some cons: the walls are super thin so you can hear everything going on, the air conditioning unit makes a continuous popping sound all day, and there can be a wait for the bathrooms. Excellent for what we were looking for. Just a place to stay for sleeping. Suzys space is safe and cozy, the temperature was just right and it was quiet. The directions to the place were perfect and it was easy to get into. Would definitely recommend! Thanks for having me good place I would deff stay again .... only thing could use a TV or speaker but things work out well Was clean walls just a little thin Good place to rest tho  Toni\\'s apartment was exactly what my family of 4 needed. While not large, the sseperate bedrooms and living area allowed us privacy and space. Totally beats paying twice the price for a hotel (Website hidden by Airbnb) apartment was in a great location. I\\'d definitely stay here again. Decent stay for a decent price. Super location friendly Great spot! It\\'s been a wonderful trip and the apartment is very clear and cozy.\\nAnd it\\'s near Time Square! I will recommend the apt to my friends. Great location, but very shabby and three crooked, steep, long flights of stairs to get to the apt. No elevator. Still can\\'t see the stairs mentioned in the description unless this was changed in the past three days.  One bath and hand towel each for four nights. Disappointed. The host is responsive and helpful. The apartment is in a great location and very quiet as the 2 windows face the back of the building. The walls don\\'t go all the way up to the ceiling (there is latticework at the top) so light and sound travel throughout this very small apartment. The place needs a more thorough cleaning and some renovation. What you see is what you get. Tiny place. Relatively clean. Incredibly close to restaurants and sights. Very easy to get to. We didn\\'t spend much time in the place, so it was perfect for what we needed. Ma famille et moi avons séjourné dans cet appartement super bien situé et bien propre. Seuls problèmes, il est un peu petit pour 5 personnes et de longs et étroits escaliers pour y monter. Mais nous avons bien apprécié de façon générale A great place to stay in NYC ! Thank you Toni ! Great location for its price. 5 minute walk to Koreatown, 10-15 walk to Times Square, about a 15 min drive to Chinatown, plenty of parking garages very close to the apartment. Has everything you\\'d get in a hotel plus a kitchen. There is a microwave sitting in the fridge but the cord doesn\\'t reach the outlet so you have to move it everytime you want to use lol. Location was a bit difficult to find for us there are no clear indications of where to enter. Be careful of the stairs it is very steep with some loose boards and spirals so choose your luggage carefully. Key is already at the location and there is no need to meet the owner elsewhere. Convenient. Overall I enjoyed the stay. A great find in NYC! Check-in/check-out very easy. Great area, felt safe late at night and could walk to many attractions in NYC. Plenty of bars and restaurants around. The beds were comfortable and the place was clean and cute. There is a windy stair case up to the room, but it\\'s worth the climb. I would recommend. Excellent location and communication. Key was not left so later check in than anticipated but Toni came within 30 minutes to get us into apartment. Convenient for commuting from penn station. location is great. Toni\\'s place has a very great location. It is a great experience to enjoy his department in New York. Hope we can meet next time. It has 2 TVs, the rooms have AC, there are lots of stairs to the 4th floor but its not bad. Apartamento muy bien situado , muy cerca del empire state  , zona animada pero tranquila . Hemos estado 4 personas perfectamente . Edificio antiguo , apartamento pequeño pero perfecto para 4 . Toni nos ha contestado muy rápido a cualquiera de nuestras dudas . 位置超级棒!就在帝国大厦的隔壁街区,走到时代广场也不到10分钟,这个地段这个价格真的不错,行李多的小伙伴要注意,没有电梯,只有很窄的楼梯,最多可以住四个人,所以拼房很划算｡房间很干净,但是确实小,不过对于住宿足够了｡Great location and incredible near to everything such as the Empire ,Times square and Macy\\'s,the bed is soft and clean, definitely a cost-efficient deal!And there is a luggage storage just downstair of the apartment.I would recommend it with 5 stars! I stayed here for a work trip and was pleased with it. Thanks to previous reviews, I knew about the narrow stairs so packed accordingly. It\\'s a typical NYC apartment and was fine for what I needed. There is not a stove, just a hot plate...and while it may have said that in the listing, i didn\\'t realize that until I got there. But since there are bodegas on every corner, who needs to cook? The location is perfect - easy walk from Penn Station and many subways. Can\\'t beat the location! Toni was very communicative as well. If you\\'re looking for affordable semi hostel vibe in a good location Toni place can fit you just fine. \\nThe pictures are accurate, what you see is what you get. \\nFor me, I\\'m a bit spoiled and I need more from my Airbnb. More home feeling away from home and that is not the case with Toni place. \\nThere is no sun light in the apartment or the ability to open the windows. \\nIt\\'s on the 4 floor with tiny staircase. \\nAnd the wall between the 2 bedrooms does not go all the way to the ceiling. \\nBut, \\nToni response fast to almost every question, he let me do an early check in and when the wifi didn\\'t work he fixed the problem quickly. \\nThe water pressure was fine and the apartment was relatively clean. \\nI won\\'t stay there again as I\\'m looking for more of a homey Airbnb. \\nBut if you are looking for good value and you are not spoiled like me Toni place can fit you good. Location location location. Toni’s place was in the middle of everything we wanted to do The wifi is an old repeater and doesn\\'t function. Everything else is as described. Toni\\'s place is in a nice and safe location, about 10-15 minute walk from Penn Station. It is clean, cozy, and up 4 flights of (narrow/winding) stairs. The bathroom was much larger than expected. There was easily enough room in the living area for the three of us and we had the basics that we needed. It was great for a short weekend in the city. On the day of our check-in, I had to initiate communication about the keys, but Toni responded with the information and even included a picture with the instructions. Thank you! Good location. Good quality/price ratio. 4th floor, no elevator El hospedaje está súper bien ubicado, entre la 5ta y 6ta avenida, a dos cuadras del subte, con locales de comida, farmacia y un recién inaugurado supermercado Target, pero el departamento no tiene cocina, solamente microondas, son 4 pisos por escaleras angostas, y no tiene ventilación natural, pero como se dice “location, location, location!!!” El resto muy bien, limpio, camas cómodas, y buen baño! This apartment is in a small building sandwiched between two large hotels. The old building is a little creaky but you really can’t beat it for location and price. It has a kitchenette with everything you could need including a great fridge. The shower is good. It is worth noting that the walls are just lattice at the top so you can hear everything in every room and light travels through the apartment as well. Great for a quick stay in midtown, easily accessible. Given it’s lively location the atmospheric sounds of New York can be heard for most of the night. Toni did a great job in communicating check in. Would have maybe liked to receive details sooner to better plan the trip. But otherwise, the space was perfect for a quick trip This was a really nice house it\\'s in the middle of the city which made it convenient to walk Toni was responsive and the location was awesome Amazing location in the heart of NYC!!! Tony is also really reactive! Tony\\'s apartment was in a great location. Perfect for our night in the city! Great location! Just around the corner from Macy’s, Bryant Park, and the Empire State Building. Also close to Penn Station and plenty of subway stations. Be ready to clubs a few flights of stairs- but this is expected in most NYC buildings. Tony was a great host. I had a couple questions regarding check-in and he was very quick to respond. Great apartment for a few days in the city! A1 place for the price Everything was as described.  Checking was quick and easy.  Location was excellent.  It’s actually near hotels that cost much more.  It’s a good value and convenient for anything you want to do.  Tony was very responsive as well. Thanks Tony for very good communication - stay was comfortable. Great location! Hello everyone. I would highly recommend Tony\\' s airbnb to anyone who comes across. It was an amazing location and only was a few blocks down from time square. It also was only a street away from the Empire State Building. The only thing I would want you to know is that the apartment is not intended for handicap/disabled people because it was very hard for my wife to climb up stairs. In order to get to the apartment you have to climb up 3 flights of stairs in order to get to the apartment. Other then that it was a great small place to stay and convenient. Convenient location and good communication with host. Convenient place to visit Manhattan.\\nQuiet and clean. Incredible Great Value! The location of this apartment is tremendous for a very affordable price. Super convenient to get to everywhere. Thats what i enjoyed appreciated the most. The indoors was just like the pictures and had enough beds for my friends and me. If you want a convenient location to spend time in the city, let Tony be your host. Cant go wrong. Tony\\'s place is exactly as advertised.  It is small but a good value for the location and essentially 4 sleeping options.  2 beds and one being a carriage bed that fit two separately plus a couch.   No living room. Kitchen and living room are the same.  Place is on a busy street but that\\'s NYC. 4 floors.  This place looks to be strictly a Airbnb.  \\n\\nWould book again for the price and location. Tony\\'s apartment is in a great location right around the corner from the Empire State Building. If you want somewhere reasonable to stay in the heart of Midtown Manhattan this is a good option.   Tony is a quick communicator for any needs. Easy to check into. This place is good if you\\'re in town touring around. You\\'ll have access to many subway lines. It\\'s simply outfitted but comes with a hairdryer, fridge and microwave. I was here for work so it wasn\\'t super ideal for that but there are many Starbucks around if you need a spot to work. But I see the value in staying here  if you\\'re planning on needing a place to crash and shower.  Place was in a central location and everything was just as listed in photos & posting, Thank you. Price is cheap for such a great location, host is available to help you when information is needed and directions are clear. Would love to stay there again for my next trip in New York. Toni’s place was perfect for what we had to to central location to every place we needed to go. We left a fur coat Toni got it and plans to mail it to us. Thanks Toni All went smoothly. Small place but excellent value given location. This is a small 2 bedroom in a fabulous location. The price is phenomenal and the apartment is very clean and well stocked with dishes and cooking supplies. The bathroom is quite large, but its diffucult to regulate the water temperature which can get scalding hot. The bathroom floor is also slanted (similar to the steps). Because the bathroom is a bit uneven the shower curtain falls in on you. Towels are small and you only get 4. STEPS Don\\'t be fooled, this apartment is not for the unfit. The stairs are steep, narrow and a bit slanted. Let\\'s say they have character. I would not have been able to carry a full size suitcase up. All said and done, the price is GREAT, the location AMAZING and the apartment CLEAN. It was perfect for our needs. Pack some trash bags, a roll of papertowels, and pack light. Also note the owner was completely inflexible on check in check out times and would not provide a 2nd set of keys. Told us we could make one at our own expense but that we would have to turn them in. Appears to be a business property with no personal touch or flexibility, but fit our needs. Tony\\'s is a great host and makes himself available for any questions and concerns.  His place is cozy, perfectly located for tourism of Manhattan, and near several subway stations.  I highly recommend Tony\\'s Airbnb apartment.  My teenage boys enjoyed the fact that it has two small rooms so they had a bit of privacy.  All electronic equipment and heater worked perfectly. In my opinion,  hard to beat this deal. It’s a great place to stay. Decent spot. Good location. Very simple spot. I rented this for my 19 year old son and his friend based on so many positive reviews.  They boys had a blast, everything worked out as Tony described, perfect location, very clean and they felt safe.  Tony was very responsive when I had questions.  We were having a blizzard here in Boston, and he came up with another apt if they had to extend their stay, which gave me great peace of mind. Tony\\'s place is at the perfect location in Manhattan. Everything is within walking distance - that saves a lot of time and money for transport. The price is truly excellent compared to Manhattan rates and hotels. It was very clean, the sheets, mattresses, towels and dishes are new and good. The wifi was slightly spotty initially (which was tolerable and we didn\\'t complain about), but it was fixed during our stay, and worked perfectly from then on.\\nThe stairs have been mentioned already. We didn\\'t mind them.\\nThe instructions we received regarding finding and entering the apartment were perfect.\\nThere is a gas water heater. We aren\\'t used to them, so we had a slightly hard time getting the temperature right when having a shower. Great location and host. I left an item and he offered to take the time to send it back to me! The apartment is exactly as it seems in the listing. I visited NYC with my two teenagers. They wanted their own rooms, so this made a better option than a hotel room. My spoiled children were disappointed at first because the building is a bit run down, but the place is clean. We arranged beds and mattresses so that each of us had our own room, and this made it comfortable. Minor drawbacks include: the water temperature was difficult to control (it was hot), somebody in the floors below smoked cigarettes so there was the smell of second hand smoke. Nice sized space. Easy check in.  Good for the cost.   Host could communicate better. But overall I would recommend and stay there again. This location is perfect for bachelors wanting to explore the city! We really appreciated the location as it made it accessible to many attractions, such as the empire state  building and time square. There were also many restaurants around the apartment so we also liked that :). Very clean and quiet, which is unusual for this busy, centrally-located area.  A short walk to the subway and lots of stores nearby.  Tony was very communicative and check-in was easy. Tony\\'s place was great for our stay! Location is very convenient and the apartment was clean and as described. It was very easy to communicate with Tony during our stay. Check-in and check-out were very easy. Thanks! Everything as expected from the description and the reviews. We needed a place to rest from touring around. This was a perfect place and in an ideal location. Tony was a very nice host and gave us simple directions on how to manage our stay. The space was nice and comfortable for two people, but the building itself is certainly very run down. We had everything we needed but if you have trouble walking stairs, this may not be the place for you. Close to everything in the heart of Manhattan Appartement très propre et bien situé. Très bon rapport qualité prix. We were looking for an affordable and convenient place to stay - this is exactly what Tony\\'s place was! Perfect price range and location for a weekend in NY exploring the surrondings. Logement très bien situé. Creepy entrance, staircase is ridiculous, old, steep, and winding. \\nTony is nice, but the place tiny and just average. Great use of space to create two bedrooms.  Comfy and so surprisingly quiet which I did not expect for staying midtown. Location is fantastic. Pros: Apartment is suitable for multiple  Great location and good communication !! Would stay again! his was my first time utilizing airbnb. The experience was superb. Tony was very communicative and an outstanding host. Every time I return to New York and need a place to stay, it will be this location if it is available. What a great experience! Thanks, Tony! unfortunately, this was my worst Airbnb experience. the couch was completely un-sittable. the floors were nice but the walls and doors were not clean, found dead bugs and the ceilings seemed unfinished/falling apart. the worst part was that I woke up with bug bites both mornings. sorry, Tony! I\\'m not one to complain but I didn\\'t feel comfortable having my daughter at your place.  Die Wohnung hat eine optimale Lage und für junge Reisende optimal zum Sightseeing. Das einzig schwere, ist es die Koffer in den 4. Stock zu schaffen. Great location. Within a few blocks from Penn Station and Empire State building. \\nEasy to walk anywhere in midtown. \\nBe prepared to carry your luggage 4 flights, but expected for NYC. Located in the heart of everything. great value, would easily stay at this location again. Was a perfect accommodation if you are looking for something steps away from Times Square. It was basic but was clean and comfortable. El acceso por las escaleras es un poco dificultoso y la habitación de matrimonio algo pequeña. Sin embargo, la localización es muy buena Great value for the cost. Not a ton of living space but a perfect location. A very good starting point to discover New York. Good value for money. Very good communication with Tony Nice place with lots of things to do nearby Le logement est très bien situé, les lits sont bons, mais l’immeune est limite, sur les photos, l’apparmement semble beaucoup plus grand.\\nLa salle de bain laisse à désirer . Had a good stay would do it again for sure Das Appartment ist für einen kurzen Aufenthalt in New York perfekt. Es verfügt über zwei Schlafzimmer mit jeweils einer Klimaanlage. Leider gibt es keinen Aufzug, sodass man schwere Koffer vier Etagen nach oben tragen muss. Die Lage ist perfekt. Das Empire State Building ist zwei Straßen entfernt und der Times Square ist ebenfalls in 10 Minuten fußläufig zu erreichen. U-Bahn ist nur 2 Minuten entfernt und der größere Bahnhof \"Penn Station\" ist ebenfalls nur 5 Minuten entfernt. Wir waren sehr zufrieden. Great place to crash in the middle of Manhattan. Clean, functional, and well located. Tony is a great host! 5 stars would recommend.  Cool place  This Airbnb is in a historic tenement building surrounded by modern hotels. The lodging was up a 4 floor walkup with a narrow leaning staircase. The building has definitely seen better days. It was very clean on arrival, but due to some mixup not enough linens were provided for all guests. After messaging the owner, additional towels and blankets were provided. Then we realized additional  sheets were not included in the new linens, we rooted around in the apartment and found an extra sheet for the final bed stashed in a bag in the single closet. The pictures for this place make it appear much larger than it is. So don\\'t expect much more than 250 sq feet divided into 4 rooms. It is very quiet in the building. Be careful with the hot water in the shower as it is somewhat unpredictable and can go from lukewarm to scalding without changing the dials. One note: we were told that a luggage storage business was located on the second floor and made plans around that, it was not available for whatever reason the day we checked out. We had to make shift at the last moment. We had already checked out (locked keys in apartment) at this point, and the offered later checkout by the owner couldn\\'t be used. Overall owner was very responsive to messages, and we enjoyed our stay in New York. 位置优越,价格有点优势,但真不要对其他有什么更好的期待,两天没有热水洗澡,爬楼梯真要命……建议多加点钱提前预订一下住附近的酒店吧 Exactly as listed: perfect location, great space, 4 flight of stairs, clean. Just what we needed for a place to stay at night! Centrally located and exactly the same as advertised. We stayed in the city for work and in the appartement just for sleeping - we could not have done more, there is no windows in the living room and it is very loud outside due to all the AC running - it is the same though for all NYC aprtmt in the area.  It is often said that property is all about \"location, location, location\".   If that\\'s true then this apartment ticks that box.  Midway between Times and Herald Squares; around the corner from the Empire State and Penn Station, its location is unquestionably in the heart of tourist New York.\\nDespite the large number of stairs and their \"quirky\" angle - the apartment is on the 3rd/4th floor - it\\'s still well located.\\nTony\\'s friendly and professional communications in advance, along with simple checkin and checkout procedures also add to the positives.\\n\\nHowever, it\\'s not always about the location, of course.  Re-reading some of the reviews whilst there (not a great sign), there were a lot of coded references to \"use as a base\"; \"a place to crash\" etc.  \\nWhilst the apartment may be \"cozy\",  it is certainly in need of significant renovation.  It\\'s air-conditioned, and ear plugs are provided to cope with the noisy units.\\nThe beds are \"functional\" although, along with the bathroom, they could do with some deep clean and renovation.\\nIn short, if you are looking for a short stay, perhaps on your own or with some mates who aren\\'t that fussy (as a \"place to just sleep\"), then this would do.   If you were looking for anything that offered a modicum of comfort or homeliness, then you would be better served booking elsewhere, as I would on my next visit. Great clean place in a great location, owner works in the building so you get fast response. Can\\'t wait to go back. This apartment is in a great location in Midtown, New York to use as a base for the exploration of the city and its major landmarks. There is a subway station quite close by for added convenience. \\n\\nAs other commenters have noted, access is via several storeys of side-leaning stairs which may cause difficulties for some guests. Overall our stay was great. Great location. The stairs are steep and narrow, not ideal for elderly people. Tony was a great host as far as your goodwill with us and the speed at responding to our requests. Some small problems we encounter in the apartment do not prevent us from recommending your rental to new guests, just intending to help improve their service, The two very favorable points were his treatment with us, always helpful, and the privileged location of the apartment. Thank you for everything and all the best for you! Marcelo, Ângela and Alda Great location. Unfortunately, the host was not accesible and willing to assist the guest during disinformation. Logement exigu accessible par un escalier très raide \\npièce principale sans fenêtre\\nBien placé et relativement calme pour Manhattan Tony\\'s apartment is in a fantastic location - perfect for a first time NYC explorer or a seasoned traveler. Thanks again for your hospitality, Tony! All the things you read about the condition of the apartment is right. The staircase is narrow, steep and sloped, but still manageable even with suitcases. The shower is working fine, but yes, one needs to get to know how to work it, so you will not scold yourself. Everything else you read is also true, but the pictures are telling it as well. It is not a 5 star hotel, but a nice little apartment with the things one needs for a short stay away from home. We did not expect more than we had seen in the pics and were not disappointed. Plenty of towels.\\n\\nThe apartment was very suitable for us – two friends – we each had our own room, a shared living room and bath and it worked just fine for us. Location is very good and within walking distance to the things, we wanted. \\n\\nWe could have done with an extra set of keys, as we tend to do separate things during our travels, but we managed.\\n\\nCommunication with Tony was very easy, responded quickly to questions and gave a very good and detailed description of the check-in procedure on the day of arrival. Storing our luggage on departure day worked very well as well.\\n\\nWe can recommend staying with Tony. Fuyez. Emplacement impeccable. Il n y a que ça de bien. Impossible de dormir nous étions 4 chacun une nuit dans cette chambre une horreur. J ai à peine dormi 2 h en prenant somnifère. Prendre une douche dans la baignoire vu l état c est un exploit. Aucun petits produits d accueil. Porte entrée un jour dans le bas de porte. Je suis habitué airbnb mais là juste une horreur If you are looking for a simple place to rest your head when visiting NY this place might be for you. The location is just awesome. The beds were clean and comfortable. It was really quiet too and we all slept well. The four flights of stairs are difficult to navigate especially going down. I only had an overnight bag. I would not want carry a large suitcase on these stairs. The bedrooms are small and the couch is old and worn. The bathroom is spacious but not for somebody with an aversion to mold. Sadly there was barely any toilette paper and the host couldn\\'t remedy that issue. The building is old and a bit scary. I could not find a fire escape. Overall if you don\\'t care for the ambiance of place and your are young and fit enough to navigate the stairs this place is a good value because of its location. It also provides everything to make your own breakfast and heat up some food which might be helpful for somebody on a budget. Very mixed feelings. \\n\\nThe localisation of the appartment was perfect, only some meters away from the empire state building and the subway station. Very good. \\n\\nBut some negative very important points.\\n\\nNot an easy access, stairs are very narrow and you have 4 floors to climb. The steps are high. I was with my grandmother and she had to stop herself in the middle to rest. Keep that in mind if you’re old or injured. You may reconsider because of the stairs. \\n\\nNot possible to let the luggage on the week end in the building . You have to find a luggage store (we paid 10$ by luggage on a luggage store near the appartment.)\\nYou can let them during the week if you pay.  Not very usefull when you leave on weekend. \\n\\nThe appartment is old and very much needs to be refreshed : bathroom is dirty, some walls too. \\n\\nA lot of problems with heating and hot water. We had to ask to the super (communication with our phone), who was not in the city. After a 8 hour flight, impossible to have hot water and barely feeling the heating. The super could only be in town the next day. What a cold first night.\\n\\nCommunication sometimes difficult with Tony who disagreed with my asking for a luggage keeper. \\n\\nHowever, Tony always replied quickly to my messages. Nice place to crash for a few nights in the heart of NY We loved it it was perfect The location is pretty good. Tony provided clear check-in instruction, the room is nice and clean. It might be a little bit noisy in early morning, since the room window is facing the street. Location is 10/10, apartment quality 5/10 max. But also it’s New York and you want a bed and not a 5* suite. Read through older reviews, everything said is accurate. Tony responded very quickly and friendly! Tony’s place is in a great location. You will be near tons of restaurants, transportation, and site seeing. Tony’s place has plenty of space and 2 separate bedrooms. We enjoyed our time there it met all of our needs! Great location in midtown. Very comfortable beds. Value worth the money. Very fast response from Tony and very detailed which was helpful when checking into the apartment. The apartment is conveniently located to many restaurants, bars, shops and two train stations.  You do have to walk up three flights to the apartment, but we did it multiple times with no issue.  Tony provided very detailed instructions as to how to enter the apartment so it was quite easy. Everything is as good as the description,  expect the stairs are a little steep and the shower didn\\'t work. Nice location. narrow and steep staird up to 4th floor. Great place very close to subway and places for food. Highly recommended! Morgan is great to work with and everything was as we expected. Excellent location in a bustling neighborhood and right next to the JMZ line. It was nice My friends was absolutely happy with that apartment :) Great location, comfortable beds, clean, spacious. It could sometimes be a little loud so you may want to bring ear plugs just in case. My friend and I had a wonderful time. Very clean place.  Great location in a quiet neighborhood.  We enjoyed our stay! We felt safe in the neighborhood, even late at night. The place is well situated and clean. However, it is lacking in basic kitchen essentials (kettle, microwave, toaster) and the wifi is poor. Williamsburg is a nice and vibrant neighbourhood. This is a nice, cozy spot in Brooklyn that is very close to the Subway. The space was perfect for a 1 night stay. No doors between rooms, but great location right next to the JMZ lines. We had a good stay and would recommend this apartment. The school busses start honking at 6 am so its a bit noisy, so bring earplugs. The bathroom and kitchen could have been a bit cleaner, and bring an extra towel because the host only provides 1 for each guest, we stayed a week and 1 towel was not that hygienic in our opinion. Great location and Morgan was super easy to book with. The building itself is a little dirty, but nothing out of the usual for older NYC buildings. Morgan\\'s place was super clean and had plenty of space.  Would definitely stay again! We had a nice stay, the apartment was we were expecting. Thanks! The location is great. The apartment is very basic, and is a bit noisy. Don\\'t expect anything more than bare bones accommodations--the mattresses aren\\'t very comfortable, and there\\'s no coffee or any other little touches you might be used to seeing in Airbnbs. It\\'s a good crash pad, though--parking is really easy and two train lines are around the corner. A fine little place in a great location. We had trouble connecting to the Wi-Fi but since we didn\\'t spend much time awake there, it was not a big deal. Neighborhood felt very safe, lots of great things to do nearby. Quiet, safe area in Brooklyn and close to local trains. Got to Manhattan within 20 minutes and the G is a short walk which takes you right to Downtown Brooklyn. Great place and comfy beds! The location of this apartment is extremely convenient. The beds are really comfortable. It was very clean. We were uncomfortable being an unlocked building, although the neighborhood is very safe. Morgan’s place is wonderful! Just what we needed for a nights stay in New York. It is an open area plan apt, but she made sure to add curtains that gave us a nice touch of privacy. The parking was a little difficult to find, but nothing that would deter us from staying here again. Subway into the city is super close and ferry is a close walk as well. We loved it- Thank you! Morgan’s space is even nicer than advertised. Super clean apt, great grocery stores and restaurants within 4 min of walking. I’m in NYC 20% of my life and I always use Air b&b. And I highly recommend this space for business travel in particular. Spacious space. Convenient. Across from metro. Good basic space We loved Morgan\\'s place! It was the perfect location - just steps away from the M line with restaurants, bars and a grocery store just nearby. The apartment was quiet, spacious and the beds were super comfortable. We had a great stay and would definitely stay there again in the future! Great location and very easy/flexible check in. The apartment itself is neat and spacious, however building itself was messy (not a huge deal). The door to the building does not lock, which we felt a bit uneasy about at first but did feel very safe in the area. Communication with host was great until the time of our stay. Had some trouble with the radiator and connecting to WiFi, which was never resolved. Not the end of the world, but a bit disappointing as we opted for a night in (I am pregnant and it was a snowy) so our entertainment options were limited. Overall a sufficient place to stay for a night or two with basic amenities, but would probably not stay here again. The flat is more like à small loft, very confortable clean and well équiped. The location in Williamsburg is Great. 1mn from Hewes subway station that bring you in Manhattan very quickly. The heat insulation and wifi connection should be improved for a perfect stay in Brooklyn.Neighbour very quiet but outside train a bit noisy.bring your ears plugs.Very Nice trendy casual café and restaurant 2mn walking distance:vélo bar and  flatsBKcafe. This apartment is in a wonderful location - VERY close to the subway and easy to navigate to, with a short commute into Manhattan. The bedrooms are cute with simple, modern decor and are both clean and comfortable. The host is also very easy to get in touch with and work with. We were surprised by a couple of things that hadn\\'t been mentioned in previous reviews - one of the windows in the bedroom (off of the fire escape) does not lock and was wide open when we arrived which made us feel a bit uneasy, there are two large windows inside of the shower which are not covered, and the occupants of the building itself were pretty loud (lots of dog barking). That being said, the street and neighborhood are SUPER quiet, making it a nice hideaway in the midst of a trip to busy NYC. It was a good place to stay for us on a quick overnight trip in the city and a good price for its proximity to the subway and Manhattan. Great place! Morgan’s place is in a great location to catch the subway and within walking distance to food. The building itself was a bit untidy, but her apartment was very clean and spacious. Neighbors were nice and we felt very safe. Would definitely stay there again! Place was clean and great location Clean place, close to trains.  Good deal for the price.  Good stay All and all it was great. I recommend it. Great location and walkable! Quiet, clean, and easy. Morgan was super responsive and I\\'d easily stay here again. Morgan\\'s place is spacious and clean. Beds are comfy. Neighborhood was quiet and safe. Everything was exactly as represented on Airbnb, if not even nicer than it seemed. Super convenient to get around and I was even able to find street parking without a struggle. Truly perfect! Thanks! This place was a great find! Super close to public transportation and BK nightlife. We had a great evening and enjoyed the spring breeze as we walked back to the apartment. The beds were super comfy and the bathroom very clean. Couldn\\'t ask for much more. Exactly what I needed for a quick night stay. And the main bedroom is nice and bright! Great location, nice clean space and great value. Would recommend to anyone needing a place to stay in NYC. The location was great as it was close to the subway situation and convenience stores. You can hear the train running at night but it wasn’t too hard to sleep Morgan’s place was great. Clean, tidy and lovely. I would def recommend it. We had a great stay over there! Great communication, accurate description, safe/walkable neighborhood, close to subway. Apartment is clean and bright. The house was very clean. Towels, sheets, pillows, and blankets were provided. There was some noise from the metro and neighbors beside and above, but it wasn’t too bad. Great walking distance from the metro and a food market store. Would definitely recommend staying here. Morgan\\'s place was conveniently located and comfortable. It was the perfect home base for our stay in the area! We wouldn\\'t hesitate to stay there again! We had a great stay at Morgan\\'s place! It\\'s very well connected to the subway and great to get around. It also has everything you need for a family stay! Brilliant place, fantastic safe and convenient location. Thank you! Prima plek voor een vakantie. In Joodse wijk. Stukje lopen en je zit in hip Williamsburg om te eten. Vlakbij metro en supermarkt. the apartment has some potential and it’s great that it is so close to subway. however, it wasn’t very clean and i wouldn’t stay there again. Great stay in Morgan flat ! Very close to the subway station that links with manhattan. Big flat with extra room and space to chill, neighbors very helpful and Morgan has very easy to contact for any issue or question. Will definitely recommend it ! Very cool apartment. Great neighborhood and very close to subway. Morgan’s place was the perfect hideaway for our NYC trip. Located right next to the J and M train, it was super easy to navigate into Manhattan. The apartment has beautiful floors, the bedroom is super cute. Both beds were super comfortable and the sheets were super soft. Morgan was always quick to respond. We had such an amazing time in her flat and can highly recommend a stay. The front entry door is broken and not locked the stairwell is dirty and smelt of urine.. we actually canceled due to these reasons .. plus the fact that Morgan told us to tell the neighbors we were house sitting. The neighbors said no Morgan lives there. .  Nor was her name listed on the mailboxes  Unfortunately we had a very bad stay for us, besides that the building was so dirty it was very unpleasant (inside and out) plus the noise of the neighbor upstairs (all steps are heard), the barking of the dog next door and The bad connection to the internet makes everything worse. On the 4th day we found a mouse in the apartment above the refrigerator eating our food, we had to stay until the next day where after several disputes they gave us part of the nights already paid. I feel that it has been such a horrible experience for us. But the reality that happened to us. Absolutely lovely and cozy place. Great location. Definitely will stay here again next time. Close to subway in to Manhattan but quite a walk to the more hip Williamsburg area with cool restaurants and shops (Bedford ave). Quite a run down area and building, felt safe in the Jewish quarter, however. Clean bathroom but could do with a proper washing of the floors. Noisy AC in the bed room, even when un-plugged it kept on \"clicking\" annoyingly for a light sleeper. Great location and a great value on a good apartment. Was happy to be right near the train and in Williamsburg. The place was clean, bright, and air conditioned. The apartment gave us all that we needed (two bedrooms, some kitchen space, and quiet enough for kids to nap midday).\\n\\nOne note, the bedrooms are separated by curtains rather than doors, so if you need more room-to-room privacy or quiet (say, for a very small child), it may be good to take this into account. We had no problem with it, but it was a bit of a surprise. On the plus side, the \"middle\" bedroom gets pitch black during the daytime which is great for toddler napping. Morgan\\'s place does exactly what it says on the tin.  Great place in a safe neighbourhood right next to the station for trains into Manhattan.  Would definitely stay again! Great space - pretty large for what we needed (2 people). Cool spot overall morgan’s place is amazing! great location and in a super safe neighborhood. couldn’t be happier- thanks, morgan! Would not recommend : ants in the bathroom, coarkroaches in the kitchen, building entrance was extremely dirty. \\nThe door handle to the appartment was even broken. Overall very disappointing stay.  Good location, really easy to get into Manhattan and good for exploring Williamsburg. The apartment building is really dirty but apartment itself was clean and tidy.  This location seemed safe, was very close to the subway and corner stores, and the lock box entry was simple enough, so it served it’s purpose for a reasonably-priced overnight crash pad. I messaged Morgan through the Airbnb app to ask if we could check in a little early, but received no response. It wasn’t a huge issue so I didn’t feel the need to follow up with a phone call. \\n\\nJust beware this is very bare bones and we almost turned around and left just as soon as we arrived; I wish I could post the pictures that I took. The building is run down, there is no door handle on the front door to the apartment so closing the door and locking the deadbolt is a pain, the apartment itself did not seem like there was much effort put into its’ appearance (smudges all over the walls and floor, broken poster frame, a dirty mop/ladder/cleaning supplies left out in the corner, no paper towels, etc.) and it smelled nauseatingly strongly of Febreeze.\\n\\nThe window in the main bedroom does not close or lock due to the AC unit; there is a gap between the window and the AC unit which lets in all of the noise from the street and is a safety issue as there is a fire escape right next to it. Again, the neighborhood seemed safe enough but I was uncomfortable with an open window.\\n\\nThe AC unit is loud and pops on and off, so between that and the cracked window to let in all of the street noise (there was construction going on in the street directly out front) we got zero sleep. The bed was comfortable, fresh towels and extra sheets were provided, and the main bedroom got a lot of natural light, so there are pros.\\n\\nThe shower (which has very light water pressure) has windows in it and only one is frosted, so I was uneasy taking a shower as people can see in if they are on that side of the building.\\n\\nOverall, if none of these things are an issue to you then it’s a decent value to stay in a convenient location close to the city. Personally, this was not an enjoyable stay and I will be staying elsewhere during my next NYC visit.  Slept like a baby Nice place and great location. Would stay there again.  A cozy and comfortable apartment with all the basics for a home away from home - including air con and a great shower! A bit of a walk from the nice end of Williamsburg but we found a great coffee shop called Northerly Coffee on Havemyer St.  The good: location. Really easy to get to Manhattan and the rest of Williamsburg. \\n\\nThe bad: We had an issue with the lockbox code, and the host didn’t reply until hours later. We ended up wasting $ making international calls to Airbnb to sort this out. \\n\\nThe AC unit in the bedroom works fine, but it’s very loud. I could barely ignore it with good quality earplugs, and did not sleep well. \\n\\nThe neighborhood seemed safe, but the building is run down and dirty. The door to the apartment is missing a handle, so there’s not much to grab on to when you try to close it.  Cons: old building and a bit dirty. The apartment itself was clean, but it had some issues: a lot of dust in the backside of lamps and furniture, for instance. During our 1 week stay we only saw 1 bug in the bathroom. The AC on the upstairs flat was leaking and the drops on our AC were very noisy. We had to put one shirt on our AC in order to reduce the metallic sounds of the water dropping. \\nPros: considering NY prices, the quality-price relationship was very good. Also the location, very close to a subway station and on a safe neighborhood The apartment complex was dimly lit and a bit run down but the apartment itself was nice and was a good value for the price.  Nice apartment, fab location. All amenities available and very fast responses. Great value. Fix your door. I cut my hand trying to close it.  The apartment was okay but I wouldn\\'t stay there again. The door knob was missing which made it very difficult to close. The apartment building was not well maintained. Morgan\\'s place was in a safe and somewhat central neighbourhood but unfortunately that was the only highlight of my stay. The noise in the apartment was far less bearable than that of my previous location, which was right in the heart of Williamsburg (Bedford Ave). If it\\'s not the noise of the J or M train, or the people upstairs, it\\'s the constant click of the aircon unit in the main bedroom that doesn\\'t even work. If you\\'re looking for a place to rest your head then the apartment will suffice. Unfortunately there were pans still covered in food and chewed gum stuck to the wall. If the apartment were a little cheaper, I certainly wouldn\\'t have minded all that much.  Emplacement moyen pour le prix et prestations décevantes dans l ensemble.\\nl appartement est grand toutefois Great location and very clean The apartment matched the descriptions in terms of spaces and location. The communication with the host was great in general, and the check in easy.\\n\\nHowever, the location is not the greatest (though that\\'s something you sign up for). There was a strong and unpleasant smell in the building and the apartment, and the pillow cases had some hairs...\\n\\nOther than that, is an okay place to crush for one or two nights. Das Appartement ist sehr viel angenehmer als der Eingangsbereich und das Treppenhaus vermuten lassen. Es ist sauber und alles nötige vorhanden. Das eine Bett knarrt. Das beste ist aber die großartige Anbindung an das Subway Netz. Es bestehen direkte Verbindungen zum Ground Zero und zum Empire State Building und die Haltestelle ist nur 100 Meter enfernt. Great apt, safe neighborhood! (: This place is ideally situated for Manhattan but be aware that the entrance is quite off putting. \\nThe place is clean enough but some common area walls are dirty and leave a bad impression. \\nA space for a cupboard but no shelves was a disappointment and we had quite a hassle getting consistent WiFI although Morgan was responsive. \\nJust a little more effort from the host could make a big difference. I wish Morgan would invest a few dollars in sorting out a few things. \\nNo microwave or toaster that overseas guest might expect. Morgan\\'s apartment was absolutely fantastic. It\\'s a short walk to the M and J trains to Manhattan and is situated in a quiet and safe little neighborhood. The apartment was pristine and offered a lot of space for the price. I\\'ll be sure to stay at Morgan\\'s again next time I\\'m in New York. Highly recommend!!! Not the plushest accommodations but very comfortable,  hospitable and clean. Perfect for a weekend in the city.  Very easy access and communication. Would visit again! Great place if you just need a place to sleep. Two minutes from the subway, it\\'s the perfect place if you\\'re going to multiple boroughs. Very safe neighborhood. \\n\\nJust know that the apartment is on the 3rd floor. Also, there two bedrooms is separated by a curtain, so keep this in mind if you\\'re staying with multiple people. The location is great, safe neighborhood very close to subway and easy to get to Manhattan. The appt is a bit bare bones, but to be expected for the price. The noise from the street was a bit loud at night, but other than that I would stay here again. The apartment smelled badly and had bugs. Good location, smooth check-in. A lot of typical noisy sound outside the apartment. Great place for affordable stay in Williamsbourg! Ailisse’s place is really nice. When we arrived she had snacks and drinks already stocked for us to have at no cost which was a nice touch. The apartment itself was a beautiful apartment. \\n\\nWe did have some issues at first with being asked to pay taxes outside of what we already paid however after confirming with Airbnb it was a legitimate request due to the area. \\n\\nI would stay in this Airbnb again! Ailisse has a wonderful apartment in the heart of the city. She was extremely accommodating and made sure to check in to make sure everything was ok. The apartment was beautiful and clean. I would recommend her to anyone looking for a great place in the city.  Great location. The real New York experience! The apartment is a great way to experience new york city like a local. I lived in nyc so knew what apartments there are like, meaning smaller and usually a bit dated. The apartment was clean, more than large enough for our family of four and with a great location in the village. We were close to everything we wanted to do during our stay. Would definitely stay here again.  Ailisse\\'s place is a great find and I highly recommend it. The location is absolutely amazing and the price point is completely fair. She was very quick with her correspondence throughout the process. 5 stars for sure!  The condo is in a great location and very cosy. Beds are very confortables and the place is clean. The Bar and snacks are very appreciated when you arrived! Being able to have your coffee out of the bed is essential and we loved it. We would definitely book again this condo. \\n\\n Great communication and easy check in. Great location right next to subway entrance. Really enjoyed our stay! Great location.  Apartment could use a bit of maintenance. The place is smaller and older than we see online especially the bathroom. But overall it\\'s a sunny, convenient apartment for a short stay.\\n\\nOur major problem with this stay was check-in, due to the failure of housekeeper\\'s digital key and physical keys, we were stuck in the non air-conditioned third-floor-hallway on a sultry afternoon for at least 30 MINUTES until the manager came over to solve the problem. \\n\\nAfter we checked out the next day, the host reached out to us for a missing apartment key. On the check-in day we confirmed with the manager of the keys we would use for entering the building, so we only took 2 building keys with us, and we had no clue where the extra apartment key was during our whole stay. \\n\\nAfter experiencing all of this, I hope the host could test all the digital and physical keys before check-in to avoid things like this happen again.\\n\\nAs for the cleanness, there were two bath towels offered, but the one hanging behind the bathroom door was wet, so my friend and I decided not to use it. Luckily I took my own towel with me, so my friend could use the one in my bedroom. Have to climb 3 flights of stairs, but great locations and amenities! Ailisse\\'s place is a great value and in a great location. Would definitely recommend staying here! This is not a 5-star experience.  We left after one day of a 5-day booked stay.  The apartment was grimy and very run-down, with non-working lights, dust, mould, peeling paint, exposed wires and so on.  Bedlinen and pillows were very old and/or very tired.  Host offered to send someone around to fix up obvious problems, but they would have taken more time to fix than the length of our booked stay. \\n\\nIn its current state, we could not recommend staying at this apartment. We enjoyed our stay at Ailisse’s place. It was large for NYC, comfortable and nicely decorated. She thoughtfully provided ear plugs. The shower had plenty of hot water. The kitchenette and living area was cozy. We enjoyed take out from the diner below and Joe coffee shop a couple doors down. Ailisse was a fantastic host, great communication throughout the whole process from start to finish and provided timely assistance when we had issues with the door lock. She was also very flexible in terms of letting us store our luggage on arrival and departure to we didn\\'t have to carry it around for hours\\nAilisse\\'s place is in such a perfect location for exploring the best of the West Village and beyond both on foot and with very close proximity to the subway station it was just ideal. Great restaurants, bars and shopping all around the area. Feels like you’re a local. Brilliant location. Great location.  Ailisse was quick to respond. Ear plugs are needed for the street noise at night.   Ate at a couple of the restaurants suggested (Hao Noodle and Waverly Diner) and both were good.  Check in and check out was easy. This is a perfect location in the West Village, close to everything, great to feel like a local for a few days. The kitchen is nice and new and clean- just missing a kettle- but otherwise perfect for making breakfast or any meals. The apartment could use a refresh in paint and in general but otherwise it was super confortable, pretty clean. The beds were confortable and overall we really enjoyed our 5 day stay, after we were finally able to get in. Check-in took almost an hour since the electronic key and code never worked but the owners brother was able to help us over the phone and we managed to get in  and after the initial stress of it all we just used the physical key and never dealt with the electronic lock again which worked out great. If you want a decent place, in the heart of the city, close walk to everything then this is a great option. It is not as crisp or beautiful as it looks in the photos but it is a bright apartment, has a nice sitting area and kitchen, two basic rooms with comfy beds and a hot shower. For us it was much better than staying in a hotel room! Thanks Ailisse! Good communication. Easy check in and out. Great location for my purposes. Good space. No issues. Fantastic location. Good communication on the part of the host when we were setting the trip up. The apartment is adequate- nothing fancy, but has all the necessities. We really enjoyed staying here! Ailisse was really responsive and the space was beautiful. Everything is as described in the listing and the photos are accurate! Great location with local amenities. Beautiful apartment, great location, and very easygoing communication. The apartment is in a great location. Unfortunately, we had a terrible experience at this property. Though Ailisse was an excellent communicator leading up to our stay, the apartment itself was a major disappointment.\\n\\nSpecifically, while the photos on the listing are crisp, bright and near-perfect, the actual apartment is tired, dark and in need of repairs, including a leak and stained ceiling above the front door. \\n\\nI arrived on Thanksgiving Day with my 77 year old mom for a special weekend in NY. After climbing three flights of steep stairs (a detail that had been relegated to the listing disclaimers when we initially reserved the property but that’s now been accurately added to the core description), we walked in the apartment and could not possibly have felt more mislead. The difference between the listing photos and the actual apartment is night and day. \\n\\nWithin 15 minutes of being there, my mom began to have an allergic reaction to something in the apartment. She has a hypothesis about the cause but I’m not including it here because we’re not actually sure about it and I want to stick to the known facts. \\n\\nWhatever the cause, we decided to check out nearly immediately and began our search for a new place to stay on one of the coldest Thanksgiving days in NYC history (yes, the place was that bad). \\n\\nMy hope was to work out an amicable and fait financial arrangement with the host (she had been very kind leading up to our stay), but instead, she shut it down quickly. Great location - a nice “home base” for traveling, quiet and in a great neighborhood but with easy access to public transportation! Enjoyed our stay and would stay again! Apartment was quirky and cozy, though also smaller and shabbier than pictures make it seem. Expensive for what it is. It is in a great location, close to many restaurants and stores and couldn\\'t be more convenient for the subway, which is literally right outside the door.  The diner below is also nice, though it was a bit weird going in and waiting in line to get the key to the apartment.  The worse part for us was the stairs, which were very steep. My partner\\'s older parents, one of whom is in need of a hip replacement, took nearly 15 min to get up the stairs, and almost fell. I don\\'t recall any mention of the steepness of the stairs, or that the apartment was on the 3rd floor, which was really like the 4th, as you had to walk up stairs to get to the 1st floor. It was fine for my boyfriend and I, but would not recommend for anyone elderly or with any type of mobility issues. Would have been an awesome apartment for half the price, but expected a little more for $800/night after taxes, etc. Also, we could not figure out how to make the tv work, and the microwave is faulty and never warmed up our food, even after 5 min, unplugging and resetting. Stephanie was a great host and made sure that the stay went smoothly. Stephanie is a great communicator, using the AirBnB system which alerts you via text messaging.  She wrote us a great e-mail, explaining how to get into her apartment and giving us tips on where to shop, do laundry, etc.  Our plans changed and she rolled with it, including waiting up for us when we got in late!  \\n\\nThe apartment is cozy and clean.  Our room was nicely decorated.  The bed was too firm for us (nothing a memory foam pad wouldn\\'t cure!).  Towels were provided.  We had a very short overnight due to travel plans. Stephanie’s place is a nice place to stay some days in NY. Is very central and clean and She was very helpful. \\nThe only thing I could recommend is to find a better place to put the key. It was no easy for me to follow the instructions and find this little box with the key inside.\\nThank you very much Stephanie for this lovely stay at your home! Stephanie was a great host, even when vacationing out of the country she was very accommodating. Thank you! Es recomendable mejor ubicado no puede estar A great and clean apartment. Stephanie was a great communicator and check in and out instructions were straight forward. The location is easily accessible, and has many great things around it. The Edison parking was affordable and close, Mercato (the small italian restaurant around the corner) was mind-blowing, and public transit was a short walk away.\\n\\nWe would recommend this to anyone looking for a cool apartment downtown and wanting to get a real feel for NYC. We would definitely stay here again! A rock solid stay Perfect location for a short stay in NYC, 10 mins walk to Port Authority. Note there is a building work going on next to the flat, so it will be noisy. The location is great! Very close to Times Square and to grocery, coffee shops, and the subway. \\nStephanie added really nice touches to the apartment and made it really confortable for us. Everything was squeaky clean .\\nThe room was exactly like described and I would definitely stay again in this Airbnb. The appartment is pretty good located in Manhattan and Stephanie is an awesome host and she helped us anytime we needed.\\nWe really recommend the appartment for everyone who visit NY. We had a great weekend in NYC thanks to our stay @ Stephanie’s place! Highly recommended for the neighborhood - great Italian place (Tavola) and Irish pub next door! Modern and spacious bedroom with good bed. Bathroom is small, but everything you need is present. Shared bathroom with one other Airbnb room (2 people). Great place Perfect spot for experiencing NYC! Lovely but small place. Great location though! The apartment location is excellent, just a few blocks from the subway. I couldn\\'t meet Stephanie in person, but she always answered my messages very quickly. \\n  Stephanie’s place was wonderful, warm, and so close to Times Square. She was a great and very kind host who responded to our questions so quickly! We would love to stay here again. Stephanie is really nice and helpful! She responds quickly when you have questions and the check in is very easy  She let us leave our luggage during be day which was really nice.\\n\\nThe room itself is very average. The size of the room is fine, but the rest of the apartment is very small, like a classic nyc apartment. But there is also another room very close and you can hear others very easily. The heater was also a bit loud during the night, so if you’re a sensitive sleeper maybe it’s not the best. It’s also on the 5th floor with no elevator, so with a lot of luggage it’s tricky. \\n\\nBut the location is solid and there is a lot available in the kitchen. It’s also pretty clean. For one night its good! The room was spacious and the kitchen was nice to have. A very small bathroom but nothing out of the ordinary for a city.  The room is located in the 5th floor of an old appartment and there was a construction site near to the appartment, so we had to wake up early in the morning. The check-in was a disaster for us, I hope she changes the lock box. The facilities for cooking were limited. Stephanie is a fair person and I sure that she will do her best to ensure you the best stay as you are awaiting for. Be aware that Stephanie doesn’t live there and that you gonna share the 2 rooms appartement with another guest. GOOD Great appartment in old house. Easy to get/return keys. Easy to get in touch with Stephanie if needed. Calm area apart from a construction site that effects the stay a bit depending on what room you get. El apartamento es tal cual como se muestra en las fotos, es muy acogedor, la ubicación es excelente y se llega muy fácil; además cuenta con todo lo que se pueda necesitar durante la estadía. Stephanie estuvo siempre pendiente de nosotros, contestó nuestras dudas rápidamente y fue muy amable y dispuesta a ayudar. Nuestra estancia fue excelente. Stephanie muchas gracias. The apartment is in a great location to Times Square and all the happenings! Spacious room for 2 people! Would definitely consider staying again! Great place. Just be prepared to climb up a lot of steps lol El departamento es muy pequeño, si hay otros huéspedes no entran 4 personas en la mesa ni en la cocina (único espacio común además del baño). La cama es cómoda y la ducha anda muy bien.\\nTener en consideración que son cinco pisos con escaleras empinadas y angostas lo cual dificulta la subida cuando vienes con muchas maletas.\\nLa habitación que nos tocó tenía dos ventanas con una tela negra que no lograba tapar el sol ni la luz del día. A mi personalmente me dificultó el descanso ya que las ventanas están al lado de la cama y da directamente en la cara.\\nLa habitación es amplia y cómoda. Easy instructions. Great communication. Fantastic location. The location is great since it is near greyhound. There are also lots of restaurant nearby that open late. However, there is a construction next door so it is a bit noisy during the day. Place is located in a great location. Stephanie was very good about communication and she provided everything I needed without issue. I’d defiantly recommend this place to others and would stay again. Very small but very worth it if you\\'re only going there to sleep! Very close to times square and many other attractions. I would definitely stay there again! Het appartement van Stephanie is een aanrader. De plek is ideaal, de kamer is ruimer dan verwacht en zag er netjes uit. Badkamer en keuken zijn wat klein. Ook moet je vijf verdiepingen omhoog, met koffers is dit wel wat zwaar. Kortom een prima verblijf. Great for budget travel! Location is fantastic, Area was safe for me to walk at night with my children :) Essentials are covered with a Market close by to get anything else you need, We cooked dinner once and there is multiple eating choices around, Stephanie is friendly and quick to respond, I also enjoyed saying hello to the other travelers, There was no problem sharing the bathroom or kitchen. Keep in mind apartment is up several flights of stairs and restroom is small so IF YOU ARE OVERWEIGHT it might not be comfortable for you. Otherwise I highly recommend! Wir hatten einen sehr schönen Aufenthalt bei Stephanie! Alles hat super und ohne Probleme geklappt. Was a great stay! Close to so much! Wouldn’t have had it any other way. Steph was an amazing host and gave great detailed directions on how to access the room and also gave great recommendations. 離地鐵與公車站都相當近,很方便! Good:\\nGood location right around the block from the Port Authority bus terminal.\\nReasonably spacious bedroom for NYC.\\nGood exterior light (at least until the nearby construction completes!).\\nReasonably clean.\\n\\nNot so good:\\nCould not reach host to deal with a problem at check-in - no response for 5 hours - very frustrating!\\n5th-floor walk-up (mentioned in reviews, but not in host\\'s description).\\nCrappy mattress wrapped in vinyl. Sticky even in cool weather. Also ill-fitting bottom sheets that would not stay put.\\nTiny bathroom.\\nNot particularly good value (though it seems that the price may have dropped). This place is exactly as described and a great deal. The location is perfect: about halfway between Penn Station and Times Square but also enough off the tourist-path to actually get a bit of the city feel. (The area has some great food options that I wish I had more time to explore) The place is exactly as described....a NYC apartment (5th floor walkup) with a nice, private, LARGE bedroom, with a small bathroom and kitchen. There is also another room in the apartment being rented. Iwas clean enough that I wouldn’t hesitate to stay again. I never spoke with or messaged Stephanie, but I didn’t have to. She gave all the information necessary before I arrived.\\nIf you’re just looking for a safe place to lay you’re head at night you’re probably not going to find anything better for the price! 因提前至民宿放置行李,前房客已退房,所以有看到房間內部,等晚上回到房間時,整間房間大概只放了一條新的浴巾以及簡單鋪床,床單完全沒有更換,睡覺時身體非常搔癢｡窗台甚至還有很久以前留下的乾掉隱形眼鏡｡\\n\\n廁所更是不整潔,非常多毛髮以及凌亂的盥洗用品,潮溼霉味,累了一天卻洗了一場非常不舒服的澡｡\\n\\n地點不錯,但是性價非常不高,寧願多花一點錢去住飯店,好可怕的住宿經驗｡ Responsive and accommodating host.  Centric location. Stephanie\\'s place was perfect for our NYC weekend. The location was awesome, very close to public transportation and within walking distance to so much. It\\'s small (like everything in the city!) but a perfect sized room for the two of us and comfortable bed. Shared with others in the other room but we all must have been out and about all weekend because we never crossed paths. Stephanie got back to me immediately when I asked if we could at least drop our bags before check in, which she didn\\'t mind at all. It was so convenient and I would recommend this place to anyone! il a été facile de contacter Stéphanie avant le séjour (disponible et rapide). nous n\\'avons pas eu besoin de la joindre une fois sur place car tout était clair. le logement correspond à la description, il est bien situé (métro, Times Square, restauration). 2 bémols : les travaux à proximité et la chaleur dans la chambre malgré le ventilateur. The place is nice and clean. Walking distance to time square. The room had a good size. It fitted 3 people with their suitcases. The bathroom was a bit small. The apartment is on the 5th floor and there is no elevator. Stephanie answered quickly and gave clear instuctions for everything! It was a very nice experience!! Una excelente ubicación, nos sentimos seguras, fui con mi hija. Cansada eso sí de subir5 pisos luego de caminar todo el día. Stephanie es amable y siempre dispuesta a ayudar. The location of this place is really great and the check-in was really easy and luckily we could leave our luggage before and after check-in, appreciated! \\nIn general it is a nice but small place. Totally fine for like a night but otherwise it gets a bit small for more than one person, in my opinion. \\nWe enjoyed staying here, only think it is a but pricey for the small and easy place, on the other side I guess that’s just NYC \\u200d♀️ Great location! Check out midtown (liberty) bagel on 35th st. There is no AC so use the fan!!! Comfy bed. Pack lightly, it’s a 5th floor walk up (ie no elevator). Great communication and let me drop my bags/leave my bags late which saved me carrying it all over before my 9pm departure. Great stay. The room we rented was great. We had the bigger room and that was really great for us. However, the fan never really helped us cool the room down. It was extremely warm and humid at night an during the day. The bathroom was much smaller than expected. I’m 5’2ft tall and I was still struggling to move in the bathroom and the shower. It is very well located, everything is walk distance reachable and the area is safe. Would not recommend for family with a stroller since the apartment is located on the fifth floor and the stairs are horrible to climb. Очень милое и живописное место в центре Нью-Йорка. Находясь у Stephanie я почувствовал себя практически жителем этого города. Да, действительно, лестница на 5 этаж сравнительно узка, но ... это, наоборот, добавляет колорита этой квартире. \\nОколо дома Stephanie мы нашли хорошее место для завтрка и всего за 15 минут добрались до остановки мегабаса. \\nРекомендую для других (как минимум, молодых) путешественников!  Great location! Close to a grocery store, lots of food places, easy access to the subway and taxis. Loved it! Abrir la ventana porque hace mucho calor, y falta más comida Great location (8min walk off the nearest Subway station), good amenities and good communication with host, was able to accept a last minute change adding one more person to the room. Downsides: 5 floors of very steep stairs, no elevator, very small bathroom that was not kept very clean and a minor issue with the gas kitchen where the other guests left it on.  Unfortunately we did not have a pleasant experience staying here. We had made arrangements with our host 6 months prior to our trip to be able to check in early and rest up from our red eye flight and have a place to store our luggage for our 1st day, I tried reconfirming the arrangements a week before our trip and did not get a response from our host until less than 24 hours before our flight to be told there was a \"glitch in the system\" (that AirBnb was unable to confirm) that allowed someone else to book the room she had said she would block for us,  so suddenly we were unable to check in early and had no other options for storing our luggage or resting up. Our host offered to store our luggage at a nearby hotel to which she said she would pay for, but upon arriving at the hotel I found out it was only going to be stored with her parents in the hotel room that they were currently staying at. To top it off while in their possession they told me water spilt out of something, everything was wet and books and electronics were ruined... which would not have happened had we been able to check in early and leave our stuff in the room. Once we did make it back to the Airbnb we were met by our host and her parents only to be locked out of the apartment and still unable to check in after 5 PM when regular check in was 4. It was a very frustrating process and not one I would ever want to repeat so I would not stay here again. Stephanie had such a wonderful little room for us!! It was perfect for my sister and me to be able to drop off things in between sight seeing and traveling. The 5 flights of stairs were a little bit exhausting in the heat, but the apartment was nice and air conditioned! The location was perfect- the apartment is only a couple blocks from Times Square as well as the bus station that we used to travel into the city, and several subway lines. Stephanie was so accommodating to our early arrival and late departure which took the stress off of carrying our bags around with us everywhere. Definitely check out 2 Bros. Pizza, it\\'s right down the block! It was a reallt convenient and cheap but delicious little pizza stop. The room was comfy and, for the price, was just what we needed for our one night stay in the city!! Thank you Stephanie! Very pleasant place and nice host ! Tks  ! Great place near times square! I would totally recommend it ! An overall good experience! Great place to stay if you want a simple and true NYC experience. Good instructions are given on how to get into this inner city apartment. A subway station to Central Park is only a block away and Times Square is about 2 blocks away. It’s a bit gritty but the place is cleaned everyday to get you ready for the stay. Great location & Irish pub directly below apt, easy check in and superb communication!  good place, larger than expected, good location. check in process is a little dodgy but that\\'s only at the very beginning and end of the stay\\n Stephanie\\'s place is roomier than many hotels in which we have stayed in Manhattan. Stephanie is fantastic with communication and is very flexible with check-in and check-out times (or at least baggage storage).  We would definitely stay at her place again in the future.  The location of the apartment is awesome!\\nAlso, we have had a lot of pizza in NYC.  Two Brothers Pizza (1.5 short blocks from Stephanie\\'s place) is some of the best we have ever had! Un bon pied à terre pour quelques jours à New York car le logement est idéalement situé.\\nLe logement est conforme à la description et d\\'un très bon rapport qualité prix. . Great location, fast response from Stephanie, all very well organized. I just think that the bathroom needs a bit of a refurbishment. Nous avons séjourné chez Stéphanie et avons été un peu déçus. La situation est super mais nous avons eu du mal à dormir : dans notre chambre, il y avait 2 simples petits morceaux de plexiglas à côté de la climatisation au niveau de la fenêtre si bien qu\\'on entendait tout ce qu\\'il y avait dans la rue et, forcément à  Manhattan, c\\'est très bruyant à toute heure de la  nuit. Manque de chance, nous étions aussi réveillés par nos colocataires qui prenaient des douches en pleine nuit  (salle de bains mitoyenne à la chambre et mal insonorisée). On a finalement mis des boules quies et ça allait mieux. Nous aurions aussi aimé petit-dejeuner sur place même si la cuisine est vraiment petite mais soit cela aurait réveillé nos colocataires quand nous étions debout avant eux, soit cela aurait été compliqué avec seulement 2 chaises alors que nous étions 4. Des petits détails qui laissent une mauvaise impression : par exemple, le rideau de douche avec des traces de moisissures.  C\\'est dommage car Stéphanie a l\\'air très sympa: elle est réactive et donne de bons conseils. Malheureusement, nous ne reviendrons pas dans cet appartement. thanks Stephanie for staying at your Place! we really enjoyed the short Distance to Times Square and the easy check-in/out It was a pleasure to stay in that precious room. Great location! AC in room. 5th Floor with our heavy bags was a challange - no complaints tho. Close to Port Authority. I would definitely stay there next time. Me and my friends had such a great time :) Buena ubicación, departamento en un 5to piso sin ascensor, limpio Stephanie made the check in and check out so easy. We we\\'re able to leave our luggage there after so we can explore the city before our flight. The explanation of the apartment in the description was exactly what we received. Otra persona ocupó nuestra habitación por lo que tuvimos que pasar la primer noche en un cuarto sin apenas espacio para estar, además de que había mucho ruido de un patio interior. al cambiarnos a nuestra habitación, esta era más grande pero el calor era insoportable, además de que también había mucho ruido de la calle. Muy limpio y con instrucciones para todo.\\nLo único es que está en el quinto piso y es pesada las escaleras great place, and great hospitality Quaint little place in perfect location in New York! You get what you pay for. If all you are doing is going to sleep at night then its worth it. The clean house with great location!\\nWe enjoy the whole journey. \\nThanks Stephanie for everything! Parfait pour quelques jours, assez bruyant mais c’est New York! Este alojamiento es super ubicado, limpio, ordenado, cerca de todo lo q quieres visitar, con una fácil llegada y con supermercados al lado This is a great location! The place was clean and just as described. It is a small apartment, but the room had enough space.  The bedroom is quite basic- no TV. For a place to just sleep and shower it is perfect. Stephanie was a great Host and we would book her room again :-) We were disappointed in our stay here. Others need to know that they may be sharing the very small space with other guests. When we walked in, we startled the current guests in the apartment, therefore I\\'m not sure they knew we were arriving that day. The kitchen and bathroom area smelled of urine and there was a musty body odor smell in our room. Cockroaches were found scurrying on the wall in the bathroom that night. We were able to leave our luggage in the kitchen after check out, however our pizza that was left in the refrigerator was thrown out (we hoped to eat this on our way to the airport). We were uncomfortable with the cleanliness during our stay. Good location, but we would not recommend for others unless the place is deep cleaned. L’arrivée était très bien organisée. Le wifi est très performant. La chambre est correcte vu le prix mais la salle de bain n’est pas très propre. Nous sommes restés 1 semaine et avons eu 4-5 colocataires différents chaque ou tous les deux jours. Great and convenient location for NY visit. Stephanie was really communicative and clear about her check-in and check-out instructions. Location is optimal if you\\'re going to spend a lot of time in downtown/lower Manhattan during your trip. There\\'s close proximity to the subway lines which made the rest of the city easily accessible. I also loved how close we were to Penn Station - which made getting back to Newark airport such a breeze! Stephanie\\'s place is optimal in regards to location. Wonderful Very good and clean. Also a great location, a few minutes from Times Square! Great location and super easy to get around. Stephanie has great communication skills and provides easy to follow instructions. If you\\'re a Filipino who craves for Chickenjoy, this is the best place for you. Jollibee is just 300 meters away. 非常好的房子和住宿經驗\\nJonathan回覆訊息非常的快速\\n讓我在最短的時間完成的入住\\n房子非常乾淨 地點也非常好 \\n住起來非常舒適 我很喜歡 像家一樣\\nJonathan兄弟兩人非常的好\\n強力的推薦大家一定要預定他們的房源\\n一定會和我一樣有美好的體驗 I loved this place will be booking in the future very clean host was very good at communicating ! Would recommend ! The Best place in the city book here ! He’s the best In the heart of flushing, a very cozy studio which I highly recommend if staying in Queens. Jonathan is also very quick with responses and easy to reach. Everything was great. The house was spacious and everything looked new (furniture wise). We had up to 5 guests and had nothing but fun. Our only issue was there was no hot water in the bathroom or kitchen, making it hard to shower. Overall we enjoyed our stay. This host was very responsive. Anytime I had a problem during my stay he was right there fixing the issue. He was also very polite and didn’t bother us. The apartment was close to restaurants, shopping and the subway. I believe they called this spot china town. Bed are comfortable not a lot of amenities in the apartment, it is clean but plain and simple It was very comfortable stay. The host was very nice to help with problems.  Great place Thanks for being a Great host. Nice place felt like home jonathan covered for all small needs someone would forget while being on the go. Thank you Check in and out was super easy and quick. Johnathan was quick to respond and was very understanding as we arrived later than expected. The location of the apt is very close to shops and restaurants in the flushing area.. as well as the subway to take you into Manhattan. Bonus the place came with an included parking space for us!\\n\\na few things to note: wifi did not work, very very bare amenities, no hot water for showers (lukewarm at best)..and cleanliness could be better. I had a great stay when I stayed at this property. The owners were great and pleasant will definitely stay there again in the future!! Amazing stay. Didn’t need the stay the night, but got a couple hours of shut eye after a shower. Everything was perfect.  Jonathan also provided me with parking which saved me a lot of time because parking in Flushing in the worst! 100% recommended stay. Host is fast to respond to messages. Check-in was smooth and quick. Good location, close to many restaurants. Clean and spacious apartment. Looks just like the picture! Lovely stay. Jonathan was very attentive and was always nearby. Easy check-in and check-out process, very flexible! Great location, tons of restaurants nearby. Will stay again! 房东人超好 住的这两天很满意 附近有很多好的小吃街 喜欢 必须5分好评 It was just what we were looking for. Convenient and replied very quickly. Check-in was easy and let us check in early because our flight got in so early. Great host!! 一般吧 Love this place, great location, great host, quick response, great apartment.\\nEasy to walk to downtown, no need to drive and park around. Only the noise when people talk and walk around the elevator area is very bothering me.\\nI would recommend staying here, and I will book again for our next trip. Jonathan’s place is great! 位置很方便,但照片与实物有一定出入｡暖气不够暖且速度慢｡但是房主回复及时｡ Cool spot, needed a few more amenities, tough if you have a car. Great location if you like asian culture an food. His place was amazing. When I entered the complex my phone automatically connected to WiFi. It seems like I have been here before. I asked for extra blankets last night and I fell asleep. He quietly came in and put the blanket over me and tucked me in. Jonathan, I think is a great guy. Easy to communicate but condo is dirty, smells bad. This condo needs renovation and deep cleaning. Condo Description and inside doesn\\'t match at all. Jonathan responded quickly and was very accommodating. Also, there was reasonably-priced 24 hour parking right across the street from his place which was worked out great. Nice simple no frills space. No curtains on the windows in the living room. Kitchen was a bit dirty but nothin insurmountable. Overall a good stay. Would visit again if needed 중국인과 한국인 밀집지역에 위치해 있습니다. 맨하탄에 머물게 아니면 괜찮은 선택입니다 Cozy and convenient. I unexpectedly had to cancel my reservation at Jonathan\\'s place.  I was aware of his strict cancellation policy but still tried to reach out to see if my situation fell under extenuating circumstances.  No reply.  I\\'ve never had a host just not reply to a direct message.  I then had to reach out to Airbnb to see if they could help.  I understood if I couldn\\'t receive a refund but it was very discourteous not to receive a reply after two attempts to try to reach Jonathan.   Especially since he is gaining income from a 4-night stay that never occurred one would hope for at least some acknowledgement to the situation.  If he had simply replied back to my private message saying no then I could have saved time in reaching out to customer service. Great coffee & breakfast just around the corner at Tous de Jour! Great location, very easy to communicate with the host.  地點很方便 N Very comfortable apartment The apartment is a good value at a good location.  Check in is easy and communication with the host is great.  We are coffee addicts and missed not having a coffee pot.  We had everything else we needed.  Parking is challenging.  Street parking is highly competitive.  There is a ramp around the corner that charges $23/day which is pretty good in New York.  Location is awesome.  We walked to Citi Field, less than a mile.  The heart of Flushing, with its big Korean community, is just around the corner.\\nThere is a security entrance to the building, so you feel safe in the building.  No bugs.\\nWe would stay there again. The place is really nice. The location is perfect. Short walking distance to the main station. Jonathan response very quickly for any inquiries.  Cet appartement fut excellent pour nous. Près du stade des Mets et tranquille le soir. Bien aménagé et propre. J’y retournerais sans hésitation. Jonathan est également très rapide et courtois pour répondre à toutes questions. Jonathan responded immediately at 8:30pm when my family got stranded at LaGuardia and needed a place to stay the night. A lifesaver! very quick responses, the place was clean and had everything needed. the view on the balcony is a beautiful touch. would stay again. \\n\\nthanks again Great location and good value. Located close to Metro 7 line, perfect for getting into the city. Check in was easy and efficient. Check out was the same. Place was relatively clean. 2 cozy beds. Not enough towels or blankets but we brought our own. No issues and again, can\\'t beat the price! Great location and amenities in Flushing, good choice for family tour in NYC. Spacious apartment, decent neighborhood, but no curtains in the living room 第二次入住了,房东很nice,一切都非常好｡ It is a good place to stay. There are many good restaurants around. It is also very convenient because train station is like 10 mins away, and the line 7 can take you to Manhattan in 40 mins. Good place...definitely have a stay...chill place for gathering and having fun!!! 非常棒的地理位置,出行方便,房东人很好｡由于2次入住,我们在这个间隙还把不方便带走的物品寄放于房东家｡非常感谢房东的帮助｡ \\nTerrible unit!  It’s an apartment not a condo!  This part of Queens is really run down with no street parking!  The apartment is befitting of the\\narea as well for the following reasons:\\n1. The windows were not air tight so the owner fixed them using brown Packaging tape\\n2. The air conditioning units were wrapped using black electrical tape \\n3. The patio door was fixed with packaging tape I guess to keep the air out\\n4. No smoke detectors in apartment for safety\\n5. Stove and refrigerator nasty \\n6. Alarm system was hanging from the wall.  \\n7.  Host check in stated “the door is open” no keys or key in or out code!  \\n8. No working lamps in bedrooms \\n9.  Tv equipment/cable box hanging from tv no stand or remote for tv\\n10. the building has chains on the doors and paper on the windows and the entry way still had a Christmas tree standing in July and the front desk looked abandoned with non working items such as the phone system. \\n11.  Cheap furnishings and bedding\\n\\nWhat I do appreciate is that the host returned 100% of our money! \\n Overall, a positive experience! Though if you plan on cooking much, you will find it challenging as I only found one wok with which to work. It also gets very hot during the summer days in the living area. Building felt safe, as well as the surrounding area. There are loads of restaurants within a two minute walk, and a bit further down is more shopping and a mall! It\\'s definitely furnished very basically, but had the necessities. Street parking is definitely a challenge, but we knew that going in! There is a parking garage only half a block away which is very convenient, if pricey ($24/day). The street itself was very quiet, as was the actual building! The only noise is from the air traffic due to the airport nearby. It didn\\'t bother or disturb us at all, but anyone sensitive to noise at night might find it bothersome. Jonathan was quick to respond and helpful when we had an issue with the key.  挺好的,性价比高 The unit is clean, and the location is very good. Jonathan is also very responsive.  everything was good The place is in a quiet area just off of Union St and near all the great food of Flushing Chinatown. The place has two elevators making the high floor great to reduce street noise. Make suree to enjoy the best Chinese food in the country which is found in Flushing. Very convenient location if you want to be close to the US Open tennis tournament or Citi field. Functional and ideal for a family of 4. The bedrooms are airconditioned but the living room isn\\'t. Jonathan is a very responsive host. The building doesn\\'t seem to be very well maintained but an elevator is available. Jonathan is extremely responsive and accommodating! We booked on short notice and he stayed in contact with us the entire time! Very clean unit! Very nice and comfortable. \\n100% recommendation Nice place ;Jonathan did his best to accommodate our needs.I would rent it again if needed. Jonathan’s home is comfortable and convenient. The room is very spacious. And it is close to subway and supermarket. We have a nice stay. 房间热水问题一直没有解决,我们随行四个人,洗澡很不方便｡只有第一晚有热水,给房东打了很多电话,房东都不知主动联系｡感觉很不好 The location is amazing and very convenient to the shopping mall and subway station. Jonathan was very responsive and helpful with everything I needed during my check in/check out and our entire stay there and brought us an iron while we were out. Only complaint is that one of the showers fill up very quick while you’re taking a shower (past your ankles). Also, there were no washcloths for showers or washing up. The neighborhood is very nice and the place comes with free WiFi and Netflix! Thanks Jonathan! Place was in a great location about 5 minute walk to Main Street Flushing. Problem was just 1 couch for everyone may 1 more furniture would be good. Also TV works but no channels and controller had no batteries. Then the panels on the walls on the floor just need some fixing. Other than that plenty of towels were ready, linen was clean, a/c worked great, overall clean place. The listing won\\'t tell you but the apartment is in Queen\\'s chinatown. The kitchen microwave was really nasty. The towels had faint stains and did not look clean. The remote control for TV had one missing battery. The main door knob was problematic and we were once locked inside and our morning plan was spoiled. The host had to come and get us out. The window on one of the bedroom won\\'t shut completely so the air conditioning in that room was not effective. The living room does not have blinds or curtains. The apartment is very close to Laguardia airport and the noise of flights landing and taking off make sleeping difficult. I do not recommend this place to stay.  My experience was so bad that I am thinking about using Airbnb again. How does this place has some good reviews god only knows. Pros: good location near food, shopping, and the train station. Spacious. Nice working elevator. Nice host. Heat works. Quiet. Jonathan responds pretty quickly. \\n\\nCons: weird smells coming from the exhaust fan in the kitchen (while we were there, we smelled neighbors burning food and smoking cigarettes). All 3 beds are uncomfortable. Bathrooms need a major cleaning and there was black mold on the shower curtain. Dishwasher had mold in it. Need some curtains or blinds in the living room and more towels. More towels would be helpful. We had 4 bath towels for 4 people, which was fine, but we could\\'ve used a couple hand towels or a towel in the kitchen.. or even paper towels (which we ended up purchasing at the pharmacy down the street). It was very clean and a great location, it’s attached to an office space though but is still very private. Great for the price! Very clean and great location. PJ was very communicative and gave great directions for check in Nice place, extremely clean, quiet close to restaurants and 33rd Street Path. Great value and communication. Such a great location, a block away from Macy’s, transit, and etc. The place was perfect for my short stay. Thank you!! Great value and location, especially if you want to stay close to Penn Station.  Lots of restaurants and shopping nearby.  Easy check in and great communication, thank you! PERFECT LOCATION! If you are not from NYC, believe me when I say this is the heart of the city. It\\'s a 12 min walk from Grand Central, 2 minute walk to the NQRW, easy and quick to Chelsea, Upper East Side, and anywhere else you want to go, but also TONS of things close by. Also, the apartment is fully equipt with glasses, knives, iron, and the wine opener really saved us! It is a simple apartment, but clean and comfortable. My friends and I would all stay again, and also recommend to our friends! It\\'s a cheap studio.  But it is clean, convenient, and incredibly low-priced.  If you\\'re looking for a low-cost place to stay in NYC, this is an excellent choice.  \\n\\nOther positives-\\nThe blankets and pillows PJ provided are very comfortable and good quality.  \\nPJ was extremely responsive when I had trouble with the access code, took  less than five minutes to get things sorted and into the apartment.\\nBathroom was very clean. The place was clean and comfortable. It’s a large room with two beds and even a back door to go outside. The good: The host was very nice, it\\'s super central, the room was relatively quiet. The bedding was nice and clean.\\nThe weird: Calling this place an apartment is really a stretch: it\\'s the backroom of a luggage storage business. There are basically no windows, and there are other guests in a different backroom. \\nThe bad: One day the shower was cold. I saw a roach in the bathroom. It\\'s very dark and generally not a pleasant place. Es el lugar adecuado, cómodo, limpio y con la mejor ubicación en pleno corazón de Manhattan. Cerca a los mejores lugares para llegar caminando o abordar cualquier tipo de transporte!!! Amazing location and can\\'t beat the price! Great base while exploring the city. Close to Central Park, Empire State, and subway. Very convenient check-in and out. Great room and location Amazing location! The space is a little small and old, but since we spent a big part of our time outside, it didn’t bother us at all. Besides, the price is good. Good location, decent value for the location. Some issues with the radiator leaking onto the floor. Radiator was very noisy at night, so woke up throughout the night. Issue with hot water the first night; otherwise, hot water was fine the second two days. Great space, very clean and great location Great Location! It was a nice place in a great location. It was a nice enough place for us to come back from a long day and get some rest- then be ready for the next day. Very close to lots of great stuff! Recommended! My family and I recently stayed at PJ\\'s for three nights and are very happy with the location and cleanliness of the place. It\\'s very accessible from Penn Stn and to major attractions around town. The only imperfection I can point it is that hot water supply for shower is slightly limited. For the three of us we can\\'t have more than four mins shower each or the hot water would runs out. So it might not be for those wanting long shower. I\\'ll definitely stay at PJs again next time. Amazing location! We walked pretty much everywhere! The ability to check our luggage the day we checked out without even going anywhere was great while we did some last min sight-seeing! It was my husband who stayed there. When asked how was his stay, he said “its wonderful”. Never had a problem locating it and PJ\\'s very accommodating and responsive. I even got a text message here in the Philippines informing me to tell my husband that the room was ready Great little gem in a great location. Good value place for sure! Muy cordial, y la ubicación es inmejorable! En el centro de todo Great place that is in a perfect location to visit the whole city and not far from anything! PJ\\'s place is a good, centrally located option for travelers on a budget.  It’s not a private studio AT ALL! The room is in a shared space with the rest of the apartment residents and you will see random people doing laundry etc. The room itself is actually behind an office and PJ will be watching you with cameras and will aggressively text you if you disobey house rules. If you stay here, be prepared to be watched and stay in a very dusty room that looks like an old classroom was converted and the WiFi is also terrible  A simple studio type room smack in the middle of Manhattan. Empire State is just around the corner. 5-10 minute walk to Time square. 3 minute walk to Bryant Park and NY Public Library. Very near to Herald square if you want to do shopping. Very much a good spot. Complete with basic things you need. Highly recommended. :) Incredible location, plenty of space for our party of 3. We brought an air mattress that fit just fine. Would highly recommend to other travelers on a budget. We enjoyed our stay here. It’s a great place and location.  We had a little trouble with communication,  but we would gladly stay here again. Pj’s place is just as advertised and he was an accessible and quick-to-respond host. The location is excellent-easy access to most parts of Manhattan.  Outdoor space is limited but if you’re looking for a clean, well positioned place to be the launch pad for your New York adventure this will do just fine, especially for the price. I was very disappointed in my stay., especially for the price.  There were 2 outlets in the room on opposite sides of the room.  Neither were very accessible.  I had to charge my phone across the room.  Not a big deal, right?  Unless your in bed!   I had to get up and walk across the room every time I received a text or call.  The bedside lamp and alarm clock were useless because there was no outlet for them to be plugged into.  Lamp didn’t work once it was plugged in.  Power strip provided was broken.  TV service is provided by RABBIT EARS! USELESS!   When I asked for assistance with this I was told by the staff member that people don’t usually watch tv, they go sightseeing. WiFi was unavailable for more than half of my stay.  Check in and check out were great, very accommodating. Great location.  Clean.  Good communication by Pj.  A one night pass through for me.  Not perfect but good value.  I would come back.  Thanks. PJ answered really fast which was fantastic since we contacted him about needing accommodation the day before our trip. The location was awesome, the room looked like the picture and it was clean. Over all a very pleasant experience. We found roaches in the apartment.  The air conditioning unit did not cool the room. It was consistently 85-95 degrees in the room. It was noisy because of the non functioning air conditioning. The only thing this place has going for it is the easy check in and its location. Small fan and small stand up Air condition unit. Room stood around 85 degrees. Was cooler outside than inside the entire day if not the same. At night it’s cooler to leave the balcony door open with noise then to rely on what’s in the room. Location is good for trains or walking downtown. I am saving this spot for the future! It is an excellent steal in the middle of mid-town. great for solo travelers or anyone looking for an authentic experience on a budget. It is secure and extremely convenient. The only reason I did not give the full four stars was because of an unfortunate hiccup with the AC that left water all over the floor while I slept. Unlike other reviewers, I will say that the apartment did get very, very cool! But the water combined with that left me ill... Hopefully, PJ will have the AC fixed for the next guest! First I will say this is my first Airbnb experience (even though I have firsthand experience in being a Airbnb host (obviously my expectations were different from what I\\'ve seen provided as opposed to being a renter.)\\nI was there for business reasons and to watch the All Star game (on Fox network which is part of any basic television service). \\n\\nI\\'ll first look at the Amenities:\\n\\nTowels - only one provided, no face cloth\\nBed Sheets- NONE, had to use blanket and pillows with no case\\n\\nSoap - yes (but the shower dispenser did not work)\\n\\nHot Water - yes, very hot.\\n\\nIron - yes (in fact there are 2 of them. NO Ironing board\\n\\nWorkspace - Yes, excellent\\n\\nTV - worst selection I have ever encountered. If you plan to watch TV, stay away. In fact, the host told me to bring my own TV (!). The most up to date show i found was Barney Miller (1970\\'s show). No local stations, no network TV. As mentioned, I looked forward to watching a Baseball game and could not. It is 2018 - basic TV (cable or HDTV antennae should be provided. There is a rabbit ear antennae there.\\n\\nWIFI - was fine, use 5g network, not what it says to use\\n\\nFridge and microwave - yes, did not use either\\n\\nBed Linens - NO. Blankets only, no pillow case nor sheets. \\n\\nHair Dryer - yes, did not use\\n\\nHangers - yes\\n\\nShampoo - yes\\n\\nMy Other comments:\\n\\t- No plug access on night table, unplug clock\\n\\t- Was not clean, was misled about that. Bathroom is dirty.\\n\\t- AC is there and loud\\n\\t- One main power plug with extension cord that can be dangerous. Example - when plugging in PC, the cord is on the floor in the room.\\n\\t- There were coffee filters, no coffee maker. If you drink tea, everything is there for you. If you drink coffee, there is nothing. When I mentioned this, the host bought a new coffee maker for me, nice response!\\n\\t- No windows.\\n- Expect a Dorm Room experience.\\n\\t\\n Great value for a quick visit or sightseeing trip. Anything you need is close by. Will definitely stay again.  PJ was very accommodating without check in and available for all questions. The place was very clean and comfortable. It has a portable air conditioner which keeps place really cool and provides white noise...we slept like babies!  There’s everything you need in the place and it was very clean. The stairs were quite steep but that seems common in NY. We only stayed one night but would use again if in NY in future.  For the price/location, awesome place. Good location, amenities were better than I expected after reading previous reviews. TV is not really that great but we didn\\'t come for that, so if that is an issue for others maybe it is something to consider. Be mindful that the host is strict about number of guests and check-in/check-out times. excellent position! just a little problem  with check in because we got the wrong keys but PJ suddenly solved. The apt was clean and comfortable.   This was my first trip to New York and as I was searching for places, this one caught my eye because of location, price (I had to book a place last minute), and it had such high rated reviews. I wish that I had read through the reviews more thoroughly though because we (me and my friend) were pretty shocked when we first got there. I knew we’d be living dorm-style, which was fine. We needed a place to sleep mostly so tons of space wasn’t a priority. But as we got into the building, we felt pretty sketched out. It’s basically a tiny dorm room randomly shoved in the back of an office up a flight of super steep stairs. The “outdoor space” in the description was a back door that lead to a janky balcony (that feels like a generous word). It also had a flight of outdoor stairs coming up that lead to a creepy dilapidated courtyard between the buildings. I was very concerned about this as it didn’t feel entirely safe. We kept the door locked the whole time and didn’t dare walk out in case someone saw we were there and came for us at night. Seriously, those were the vibes. The only positive things that I have to say about this place is that it’s location, as far as things to do and see, is phenomenal. It’s within walking distance to great shopping, sightseeing, and the subway. We were also able to leave our luggage there for the day because checkout was way earlier than our flight home. \\nThis may sound sexist but if you are a single woman or even two women traveling, DO NOT STAY HERE. We did not feel entirely comfortable but felt obligated to stay because of their strict refund policy. We should have left and demanded a refund. I really regret not just doing it but I sucked it up. If you’re a woman traveling with a man or a couple dudes traveling together, have at it, just know there’s a reason it’s so cheap.  Instructions about check-in and out were communicated in time and detail! The location is excellent. The apartment is very clean. It’s of great value for its cost! Un bon endroits à Manhattan pour profiter de NY Pj\\'s apartment is in a great location-right in the middle of everything! It was clean, quiet and comfortable. PJ was very nice and easy to work with. I will definitely stay here again! Super convenient location!\\n\\nThe host was very prompt in his responses. He made sure we had the correct check in instructions. (I was arriving 2 days later, my friends arrived first). When my friends didn\\'t respond he made sure one of us had the correct check in instructions. \\n\\nHe was very friendly and also showed my friends the way to our place when they arrived first. My stay at the apartment was great. Centrally located and right next to a good bar for dinner Just be careful to ask (in writing) any questions or concerns you have and get commitment from PJ and what he is willing to do and make sure he follows through.  He was not very honest or responsible in my opinion. Very clean, cozy and convenient. PJ is very responsive and a great host. Thank you! For those looking for a comfortable but no frills crashpad in midtown, this studio is for you. Quiet room with a couple of comfortable beds and a three quarters bath. The linens were quality and PJ himself was very polite even with my missing my connection and arriving over three hours late. Painless, combination check-in process. I\\'d stay again when making a quick 36 hour business trip. Nice little place conveniently located within walking distance of ESB and Penn Station. In the heart of Koreatown by numerous, great places to eat and shop PJ is a very communicative, generous host. His place is well located In a safe and vibrant neighborhood with lots of amenities. A really great value! The good thing about the room is the excellent location, central and well connected. The beds were very comfortable and has its own bathroom.\\nThe bad is practically everything else: glasses, plates and cutlery with remains of food and drink.\\nWe found a cockroach in the room, they did not takr out the garbage until the second time we asked for it.\\nThe room had a small window that could not be opened and a door that opened onto a yard full of rubbish.\\nThis made it impossible to ventilate the room properly, which smelled closed and was very hot. It was also very noisy because of the air conditioners and because the yard was the back of a bar.\\nIt had pans but no kitchen element to be able to cook. And there was no room to wash the dishes we used, so we would scrub them in the bathroom and let them dry in the shower. \\nThere isn\\'t a studio is like a hostel with a room with private bathroom. And sometimes the office\\'s door was open and we thought was unsafe. good location, bathroom a bit unpleasant with the smelly shower curtain, but other than that its fine Ce n’est pas un appartement ni un «\\xa0logement entier\\xa0» mais une piece au fond d’une société. \\nAppartement bruyant (air conditionné extérieur + voisinage). \\nAppartement sale, j’ai été surpris par un cafard sur mon lit en m’endormant... \\npour 150€ la nuit...\\nPar contre très bien placé, collé à l’empire state building. \\nPour ceux que la saleté et le bruit ne dérangent pas.. In our opinion this place is a real jem comparing to other NY accommodations.\\n\\nThe Pros:\\n-Amazing location (15min to Broadway theaters and Times Square, 3min to Subway, 10min to empire state building), feels very safe at night as well. \\n-Just 2nd floor so not a lot of climbing up the stairs with your luggage.\\n\\nThe cons:\\n-if your sleep is light take into account there is a noisy air con engine roaring from outside, also the air con in the room is noisy... Pj provided ear plugs (But we sleep easily so we didn\\'t have problem sleeping without them)\\n-There is no real kitchen (no sink or gas), so prepare to eat outside :) Nice enough place, everything we needed, and great location. Just a heads up, this is a room in the back of a laundry mat. It’s a business these guys are running essentially like a hotel but calling it an AirBnB. The door to the room is a bedroom door, thin and flimsy and there’s no deadbolt. I didn’t feel safe staying here so I left. Pj\\'s place was exactly as we expected. There weren\\'t a lot of bells and whistles, but that\\'s not why we were in NYC. It was the perfect home base for all of our sight-seeing adventures. The location is PHENOMENAL!!! We were even able to save a little money by preparing breakfast a few mornings because we had access to a refrigerator, toaster, and microwave. If you are looking for a place to lay your head without a lot of frills, Pj\\'s place is perfect. L’appartement de Pj était très propre et correctement équipé pour un petit séjour (pas de cuisine mais micro onde, bouilloire, frigo et cafetière). Il est très bien situé à quelques pas de l’empire State building. L’appartement donne sur une cour intérieur un peu bruyante à cause des clims mais malgré cela je recommande cet appartement. This location is unbeatable. PJ was absolutely awesome with communication. Can’t say enough good things. Excellent location. The place offers everything you need for a comfortable and convenience stay in NY. I\\'ll stay there again next time I\\'m in NY. The place is on a great location. Noise (like snoring) can be an issue since you’re sharing a space with 3 other people separated by a curtain. This place is more like a  Hostel rooms are very small . Good thing is it\\'s close to everything  You want. Don\\'t know if I would say there again The place is OK if you are in the mood of not staying for long at the room and going out and get to know some of New York\\'s major attractions which are very close.\\nWhat you get is not actually a room, but a bed and a desk trapped between walls (literally no space between the 1 person bed and the wall) a wall that doesn\\'t go up to the roof completely, providing zero privacy (you can hear your neighbours snoring, can\\'t have a phone conversation, etc). That being said, value is ok, as again, you are close to everything in an area where rooms can get up to hundreds of dollars. Cool place. Great location. If you don\\'t mind the open area and tiptoeing around it\\'s a good spot. Just really cold all the time... they should put heaters in the (Website hidden by Airbnb) so cold it\\'s a struggle. Rather than save a few bucks the owners should definitely invest in small fan/heaters. Great place. I would stay again. It\\'s not the Ritz but it works for the avid explorer or someone who needs to be forced out into the world . Genius space. 숙소의 위치가 찾기 쉬웠고 중심가에 위치하고있어 도보로 미드타운 일대를 다닐 수 있어서 좋았습니다. 다른 지역으로 가는 것도 서브웨이 스테이션이 숙소와 인접해있어서 여행하기에 최적의 위치를 갖고 있었습니다^^ It\\'s cheap and good location. Good economic place iyi warehouse Pretty neat, clean, functional, to the point. Loved it. Its a trapped Great location. Nina place was good for the cost. The room is like a closet space tho. The room was clean and was given complementary towels.  While the room is tiny, it is exactly like advertised. It was clean, and the bathroom was also clean. No complaints here. Great location! Good location, very tiny space, fine environment. A cheap and decent choice to stay at Manhattan Nina was an attentive host, and answered any questions as needed. The one thing that I absolutely loved was the quality bed, which felt like sleeping in a marshmallow.  The location is excellent, walking distance to Penn Station, easy subway ride up to Times Square, and a few blocks from Macy\\'s.  One result of being so close to everything is the street noise in the apartment.  However, it\\'s nothing major, and every New Yorker knows that\\'s the sacrifice for convenience.  Still, Nina was kind enough to leave ear plugs, if needed.  As described in other reviews, the room is a partition and shared with other guests, so you would need to be mindful of noise and light and hope that the other guests are too.  Overall, for location and accommodations, this place was a great stay. Location is perfect, check in and instructions perfect, a block away from the Empire State Building. Can’t wait to go back! everything was great! The place  was worth the money. Really good location, wifi was good and the place was clean. The host was also really helpful and responded fast with concerns. Nice place Hi everyone, I highly suggest Nina\\'s place because it is the perfect place if you want to stay in the center on NYC. The Times Square is just ten minutes walk form the place. The price is affordable, comfortable sheets, super clean bathroom!!! I enjoyed my stay at Nina’s place. The location is excellent and I got good instructions for the self-check-in. Exactly as described. Small space with very comfy bed. Other guest could be a tad loud during the day. Very comfy bed. It\\'s pretty much a hostel. Nina’s place was great! It’s nothing fancy but it’s the best deal you’ll find in NYC for the location. I’ll definitely be coming back! The place was exactly as described on Airbnb. It was clean, had amenities including fridge, microwave etc. The host was very receptive and provided accurate instructions for the room. Will definitely stay here again. Thank you Airbnb and Nina Le logement est conforme à la description, Nina répond très vite, après pour ce prix, il ne faut pas s\\'attendre à du luxe, c\\'est même plutôt l\\'inverse ici mais difficile de faire moins cher en plein cœur de Manhattan donc très bien pour poser ses affaires et dormir (si on est pas claustrophobe et qu\\'on met les boules quies qui sont fournis) Great location, Easy to communicate, Clean and nothing to complain. It will be a great choice for you if you want to stay in the heart of New York and save money! Nina\\'s communication and follow-up was fantastic. Wonderful place to stay in NYc. Close to everything. Great place to stay, very close to everything 可以清楚听到隔壁做私事､打呼噜和电话的声音｡隔壁很可能半夜开着灯,导致你的房间半夜很亮,而你无能为力｡\\n你不能很好的打电话或者大声做事,因为房间的声音可以完全传出去｡\\n墙不是完整的,只是一块板,且房间与房间之间的上面相通｡\\n\\n位置良好,但是黑人和流浪汉在附近很多｡晚上楼下是酒吧｡ Good place with an excelent locación. Very accommodating host, thanks a lot!  You’re getting what you pay for. It’s a great location, good price, but essentially the bare minimum. If you’re exploring New York the way I was, that works perfectly. Just hope that the guests around you don’t snore - one of mine did and the earplugs only help so much! Good stay Good La ubicación es realmente maravillosa, si bien es un lugar muy pequeño, vale la pena por el precio y por la ubicación, además si vas a Nueva York no te la vas a pasar todo el tiempo en tu habitación. Perfect location The place is just as advertised. Great location, within walking distance of Tmes Square and all the other landmarks of New York. Staying in the centre of the city let me explore the heart of the city by walk at all hours. i even managed to squeeze in a run till the United Nations building early one morning. There is a diner almost next door that serves very good breakfast. Wifi is blazing fast.  Great place for a cheap stay. It’s my third time back and it’s always a good experience. Amazing location. Electronic doorlock, so you can check in at any time after they clean the room. Comfy bed, small room. Some amenities like iron, fridge available. The low walls can make sleeping hard if you don\\'t use the provided earplugs. Place is totally fine, and reasonably clean. You’re getting what you pay for, cheep and good location.  Check in is done with codes/lock box, which is convenient. Great stay Excellent location, great price and easy to self-check in. Just great for one night Good value for NYC, but just be aware these are extremely basic accommodations, pretty much a hostel.  It\\'s a cubicle with a small bed, walls open at top so you can hear other guests and see their lights, kind of hot...  If you\\'re used to hostels and just need a place to sleep, you\\'ll be fine.  Check in was very easy with codes and lock box. Host was good with communication during the day.\\n I would not recommend staying at this Airbnb. I ended up not staying here because of the cleanliness of the room. The Airbnb itself is actually a luggage storage business that you had to walk through to get to the room. The room itself is a closet at the business (which I think is illegal). Literally just a bed. No air conditioning and no lights in the room. Definitely spend the extra money on a hotel room.  The place is good for those who are looking to save money when staying in NY. It is pretty basic and the bed is somewhat hard to sleep. If you are a light sleeper the noises from other guests can be an issue. The walls are pretty thin and don’t go up to the ceiling. The washroom can use some cleaning. Otherwise for a quick stay for the price and location can’t ask for more.  The place is in a great location, on a walking distance to many interesting sites in Midtown, and close to the public transportation.\\nThe communication with the host was great. \\nThere are 4 rooms separated from a taxi/luggage office by a door. You have to go through the office to get to the washroom. \\nThis room is very small and fits better a small and slim person. \\nSince the walls don’t connect to the ceiling, you can hear everything people on the other rooms are doing and they car hear everything you do. For this reason, you also can’t make phone calls in the room neither turn on the lights after midnight. \\nI recommend this place to who is looking for a quick stay in a great location, but don’t mind the lack of privacy and lack of space.  Great Host was very quick and responsive. Very friendly too. Definitely a nice spot for one person. Very secluded in its own spot. Nice location where you can walk to anything. Don’t expect a lot of space though, it’s very small but it works wonder if ya need a last minute space for another night in the city. Tight space but great to lay your head Comfortable bed at a location central to a lot of places in Manhattan. Small bedroom but the location is great, really clean and cheap. Get what you pay for super great location! Great centric location, just be aware that sound isolation between rooms is very low, and that those rooms are really small Good location. Although I was not able to turn on the light in my room, I was satisfied. It was a small room with a bed and a table. I recommend you to prepare eyemasks because it was too bright to sleep due to stree lights through the window. It was a good stay This was precisely as advertised. Great for needing a place to sleep right in the heart of the city. This room was exactly what I expected for a solo trip. The pictures give you the perfect idea of what you\\'re paying for and it was actually cozier than I expected. I found it clean enough but there are slippers provided if you need them. \\n\\nThe other guests kept to themselves and I hardly ever saw them. The bathroom was always free for me when I needed it. The walls around the bed were lower than I expected and on some nights the other guests kept their lights on hours past the midnight curfew. Enough to annoy me but it didn\\'t ruin my night. If you\\'ve ever had quiet roommates you know what to expect. The webpage also lists complimentary soap and shampoo which I did not receive so I had to buy my own.\\n\\nStill the location is in my favourite part of the city and since I was travelling alone the value was too good to pass up. There are four doors that are always kept locked so I always felt safe. When I travel to New York again I will definitely be checking out this space again. Good room for the Price. The place is fare with a good location but really small and I couldn’t feel privacy or quietness due to the rooms setup and noise from street Hard to beat the location/price combo. Not the most ritzy place, but if you’re mostly looking for a place to shower and sleep, it’s great. It also has a desk and wifi if you need to get anything done. Great deal Cheap place to sleep Great value. As advertised, it\\'s a pretty solid place for the price and location Good place excelente para venir a visitar NY la hospitalidad es excelente Amazing location and cleanliness. Good value. Recommended for solo travelers Good place for the money, bring an eye mask and some ear plugs, you can hear all the other guests and their lights may keep you up. Conforme aux attentes. Bien placé.\\nBon rapport qualité prix Nice place Good place. Great location and clear instructions. It\\'s a nice little room. Really central! Would recommend for a short stay or just as a place for the night. Probably my concept of privacy is different from the average newyorker but to me this room is not private at all, the pictures don’t show that the beds are just surrounded by 2m tall cardboard walls with 1m open gap from the top of the wall to the ceiling, so you are basically sharing a big room with 3 strangers that you can’t see but definitely can hear every movement you make. Other than that the location is great, right in the center of manhattan. Just disappointed by the (non) separation of the rooms. The place is good.\\nAnd Price is also good. Simple room, quiet place, great location! Cheap, you get what you pay for. You get exactly what you see :)\\nAnd in my opinion it\\'s the perfect place to stay for a small amount of money in the heart of Manhattan. Room and Bathroom were both clean and tidy and there wasn\\'t a problem to bring my luggage earlier or leave it there after the check out.\\nThe rooms are small but I only was there to sleep and so I don\\'t care about their seize :)\\n\\nI can recommend this place! 저렴하고 좋았습니다. Great for single travelers and quick trips. La location est excellente. Elle est au centre Manhattan (midtown) , 5-6 mins à pied à Times Square. C’est une très bonne place pour un célibataire (Homme) qui voulait voyager en court période. L’endroit est propre ( la salle de bain partagée à l’extérieur ).\\n\\nDéfaut: dans ton chambre, t’attend bien que t’es voisins ronflent.\\n\\nC’est un trade-off. Personnellement, je suis une personne qui pourrait dormir très bien après la visite d’une journée à extérieur. Mais pour ceux qui est sensible au bruit, ici, peut-être pas une très bon coin pour vous. The location is perfect 5mins walking to Times Square but the room is too small and you can hear everything from other rooms. Place is ok if you are planning to stay for one or two days The ad made it clear that the rooms are not completely closed-off/private, as the walls do not go all the way to the ceiling. Unfortunately the person in the next room both left his light on all night (making the entire area lit) and had his alarm go off beginning at 6:30 AM, meaning that his alarm went off for me as well, both of which were violations of the rules. If the host is going to provide rooms in that condition, they have to hold guests accountable. Why should one guest be able to make the living situation for another impossible, with no consequences? The moment you are unable to sleep, the room\\'s low price becomes way too high. Great location, close to everything.\\nNice for solo travelers. The price is reasonable and everything is okay. Thank you so much. Thx Nina! Again, remember to vote for me for Governor of New York! Check my stuff out here (Website hidden by Airbnb) ;) Amazing place! Amazing location, perfect for solo travelers. Would definitely stay again and again. A+++++ thank you! Great location and Nina was very communicative! I\\'m not going to lie, this particularl location is a lot more sketchy than the host lets on in the description. It\\'s fine. It\\'s a fine Airbnb for a few nights stay, and it is in an excellent location. However, it feels unfair to call it a private room due to the situation with the walls (which you should definitely take note of). It feels more like a dorm situation where you can hear everyone around you and they can hear you. To clarify, this was not an unpleasant stay, but you should be prepared to feel a bit uncomfortable for the first night. Overall, not a bad stay, but I probably wouldn\\'t stay again. This was my first stay in an Airbnb apartment and it was excellent! Very affordable, clean, comfortable, and safe. The location was perfect and Nina was always was quick to respond if I had any questions. Exactly as advertised.  Really good location and value for price. DO NOT FALL FOR THE HOST PICTURE. HOST IS NOT A REAL PERSON.\\nHOST IS A MALE. BE AWARE.\\n\\nThe whole experience is shady. From start to finish. Airbnb should verify who the real host is by checking their identification.\\n\\nFirst thing, there is no such person name as Nina, it is a fake picture of some girl and the host is actually a business, not a person. I know it because the owner is Korean male, and the receptionist is Korean male, he just text all the guests pretending that he is a Nina.\\n\\nSecond, when I first booked the room, it did not mention anything about the open ceiling. And the host should have know what \"Private\" means in English. \\n\\nThis is not a room!, this is a 4 cubicles with 4 dividers and they just put a small massage bed and they call it a private room. Look at how lighting from next cubicle shines my cubicle at 2:00AM, you can hear next guy talking to his girlfriend, watching a Youtube video, snoring and just about everything.\\n\\nThird, the air conditioning is so loud, I thought I was sleeping in a warehouse or something. Again, this is not a residential area, host just made a spare business room with the temporary \"Wall\" without ceiling and they call it a \"Private Room\".\\n\\nI will file a credit card chargeback against Airbnb if host do not compensate with full refund of my money. What i expected for the price. location is convenient for amtrak and the port authority. quieter than i expected. Great location. Good communication. Thanks! This room will be smaller than you expect, you will probably hear people snoring throughout the night, you will have difficulties sharing one shower with so many people. The best part of this place is the location and price, but neither offset everything else. Also, Room C does not have electricity as of my departure, so don’t stay there until it’s confirmed to be repaired.  Las  fotos son reales, es muy económico, pero si eres sensible al ruido no descansaras mucho por qué el cuarto hace muchos ruidos internos, siempre suena agua caer, y como las paredes que separan otras camas no llegan al techo siempre escuchas todos los ruidos de todas las personas, tiene una ubicación excelente y por el precio está bien. Host was great. Very responsive. It’s a hit or miss in regards to the neighbors who are going to be staying with you, but can’t really complain because of the price and the perfect location which is exactly what you need in new york city. Nice place to stay in the heart of Manhattan. Perfect communication with Nina before and during my time here. She think even for the noise other guests may make and placed war plugs. Super affordable and perfect for a few nights stay! Very good value, cheap given the location. Nice place, clean and close of everything get what is paid Correct I enjoyed my stay, everything was good \\nThank you\\nFila In the same way of the other comments. Excellent location, easy to arrive and is a little bit better than pictures show. Perfect for travelling alone two/three days and spend your time in this marvellous city\\n Great location, the few minutes from Times Square. Can beat the value. You pay for what you get. You\\'ll have a clean twin size bed with clean Linens, access to a clean bathroom and internet. Comfy place in great location. When it comes to the price, its reasonable in comparison to other NYC properties. Privacy is limited beyond a visual separation of the bedrooms. I can recommend this place though if you look for a place to crash and sleep for a few nights. Organization and communication was done very well, no issues whatsoever. Perfect for a budget stay! Great price for location and accessibility for single travelers! Host was prompt to reply and was sensitive to the guests’ needs. Will definitely stay here again in the future. Affordable and great location. The place was exactly what I needed for a last night stay. Great location, but dont expect anything rather than a bed to sleep at.. I will never stay here. Everything is bad. It honestly is not a bad place. The location was amazing and it’s near foods and Times Square. \\nHowever, it rained very heavily the second day was there. The roof started leaking on the bed. I’m glad I was there when it happened because my suitcase was the first thing to get wet. \\nI wish I could have gotten more of my refund, because I didn’t want to have to wait for someone to fix it while it was still leaking on the bed. I had I get new place which ended up costing me a lot of money. \\n\\nHonestly—it’s a cool place. Exactly what you’d expect. Just be careful it if rains. If you want to stay in a (for NY) cheap room with a great location, this is the room what you should book! Good communicaton, great location. Really small room but you don\\'t need anything special if you just go there to sleep. Totally recommend, thank you. Everything ok. The room was ready one hour before my check in. That was very convenient. \\nLocation is unbeatable. Everything is near.  You get what you pay for. If you just need a space to sleep at night because you will be gone all day. This place is perfect. Even though it is small it worked well for my quick weekend trip. The value for that part of town is great. The place was what was described in the listing. Nothing fancy, but a good place to sleep It’s basic -a cell in a partitioned room - which comes with some minor noise and light issues at night (all of which I expected and was cool with) The location can’t be beat though and therefore the cost is very reasonable. The room was exactly the same as the one shown in the photo. Nice room and environment for short stay. Awesome location. Just the room was a little too cold during the night. Everything else\\'s was good. Easy access to anything Midtown. Tight space but clean. Great location and seems more like a hostel but you have own private space.  I probably would have stayed couple more nights or go back next time. That\\'s a cool place! If you travel alone you have to stay here. Really f@@kin location cause you re on herald Square so you got everything here. It s clean and organized. The room C is like you see by the photos. The rooms are private but you can hear everything by your neighborhood :-) So.. it s good use the ear plugs. Bathroom is warm and with accessories. Shower is comfortable and clean. What can I say more? I was lucky with my neighbors. I stayed for only one night . It was perfect for me because of the location near to time square , Empire State . At night I got a guy the snore really laud and I could here from my room . The rest I’m happy and I recommend if you are looking for a place mostly to sleep with an outstanding location! I had a great time! Thanks! El lugar está muy céntrico, si quieres visitar Manhattan es el lugar ideal Overall, It was a good experience and the location is ideal when visiting the city. Access to the location was easy and it is a suffiicent space if you plan to be gone most of the day. It is a tight space but it did not prove to be an issue. It is in a pretty noisy part of town but it did not bother me too much since it is in the city. Fila is really responsive and helpful. - Great location, easy check in / communication Excellent location in midtown, good enough if you’re meeting places the whole day. It is what they say it is, a family apartment they opened a room for travelers Jennifer was very nice and communicated very well but the problem staying there is the kids I didn’t sleep at all due to the kids playing games while on the phone all night literally from when I checked in at 10pm to 6am the kids was very noisy. My experience was bad and the House has a horrible smell It is exactly what the description says For accommodation in New York City, this was extremely cheap! I would highly recommend if you are only staying there for a night. However, I would not recommend if you cannot sleep through noise or are in town for a long time because there was quite a bit noise (son playing video games) until 2 am and the room was pretty small. The bed was REALLY comfortable though! Great! Cozy, just what you need. Clean and quiet. Great hospitality. Jennifer’s great with communication and makes sure you feel at home! Jennifer is really responsive! The room is basic but good value for the price Close to Long Island RR Just go toward Broadway and walk past Broadway Junction train station Jennifer is a sweet and kind lady. She was very understanding and helped me with directions to her place. Unfortunately once I got there it became a not so good stay. The livingroom/bedroom that they sleep in is right in the front as you come in the door. Its next to the private bedroom. I checked in a little before 10 pm on Friday. There was a kid playing video games literally all night. He was yelling, cursing, screaming, and just generally being loud as he was playing and talking the other people he was playing games with. This went on all night until 7 am Saturday morning. To make it worse, he went to sleep at 7 am but I wasnt able to sleep at that point. Saturday night I stayed up till 11 pm. It was loud till about 1 am with adults. After they went to sleep, here comes the kid again playing video games all night. I managed to go to sleep but was abruptly awaken at 6:16 am by again the kid playing video games and being loud. This is unfortunate because Jennifer is very sweet but this shouldn\\'t be an Airbnb. The room is small but that\\'s manageable. It\\'s the noise that gets the negative review. Also, it\\'s worth mentioning her place is literally a block away from the projects. If you\\'re taking the train, you have to past the projects to get there. Unfortunately, I wouldn\\'t recommend this place. Had a last minute reservation and jennifer was able to accommodate me.  The apartment does have a weird smell. The listing makes note of it being a family apartment and to expect noise which is fine but this was a little excessive. The room is right next to the room the kids were in and they were watching videos for much of the night which I actually didn’t mine for the earlier part of the night but this went on until about 2 am. The room was clean but it was just too much going on here. na Terrible place. Cockroaches in the room, place is dirty, unpleasant smell, all the negative things that you could imagine in a home all in this one very spot. The place is good for one who does not  mind the sound in the early morning or pets. And the place is convenient to catch subways. There is no elevator there, a little unconvinced if you have a large suitcase to carry. Overall the stay was fine. Outstanding value and help from the host. The negative is that the \"private room\" door can\\'t be locked. It\\'s perfect if all you want is a place to crash and to save some money. Nice host The place was ok for 1 night . No issues. Yes some noise will be there Such a nice, kind woman. The room is very comfortable and the bathroom was clean! Habitación muy limitada en Piso muy humilde, muchos niños por todas partes y cucarachas en el suelo The place is just as described on the website. Good place to sleep for a night. nice people. great location  Room was very clean! Bed was nice and comfortable. Host was super nice, loved the flexible check in time. Great place to stay if you’re in the city. Jennifer places was very clean, quite, and comfortable.  I slept very well.  The advertised room picture is very accurate.   It is conveniently located, to stores, and public transportation.  I would definitely stay there, again.    if your looking for a check in and check out  it\\'s okay. The room is lovely. It looks just as the photos online. The bathroom which is not shown was very clean and close to the room. Jennifer and her family are very kind and make you feel very welcome. But please read the description of the apartment carefully because it does state that this is not a quiet apartment. \\n\\nThe location was amazing! There is a grocery store and a deli near by, and the walk to the train station is about 5-7 mins! \\n\\nI really enjoyed my stay in this Airbnb. I would recommend it.  I really enjoyed staying with Jennifer!  If one would like a quiet private room at dorm prices, wether it is for a day or a week, Jennifer’s room is a great stay. The late 7pm entry could be a downer for some. But comfortable bed, free WiFi and clean room, puts one at home right away. Noise annoying kid was up till 7 in morning Nice place Just as expected, the place was private and clean. The apartment itself was a bit hot but the room was kept cool with a fan and the restroom was right next to it. Definitely getting money\\'s worth.  Good place for this price Nice cool room very close to the A&Ac train My stay at Jennifer\\'s place was very nice.  The room is simple and everything was centrally located. A nice place Jennifer\\'s place is close to train station, was sparkling clean and good for the night. I would bring earplugs though due to thin walls. The place is nice and clean. The subway is only 5 min away. Overall good experience. Very clean quiet private and polite. Exactly what I needed after a long trip. No confusion during check in and I was provided with the amenities I needed with a smile. Terrible place!!! First of all this place stinks. I’m not kidding it’s mushy, filthy  and disgusting.  Also, when people said this place is loud, they really meant it! The kid was playing his playstation all night and screaming at other people at the top of his lungs. It came to a point where i left at 4am because I couldn’t take it anymore. I would rather sleep at the airport than staying at this place. Also there is no lock on the door and i felt very unsafe, given this was a very shady apartment. Good spot if you’re traveling on a budget. Close to the J, and C train. Had a great stay As expected, this solution is good only for one night. Closed to the underground, it takes 30 min to reach Manhattan. Jennifer son is quite noisy... The space was very clean, comfortable, and private. There was a bathroom but it was shared with another family who all took showers in the morning so I was unable to freshen up or use the restroom before checking out.  Located very close to the train, and there was a deli nearby. The only issue with my stay was that a young man was up all night yelling, watching movies, being terribly disrespectful to Jennifer for no good reason. Due to this I wasn’t able to get any sleep and wanted to try getting a refund. Not the easiest to get to if you have large and heavy overnight bags because of the stairs. В доме вонь нереальная. Полотенце так сильно воняло, что им не хотелось вытираться. Хозяйка в порядке, общительная, деловая. Квартира в жутком старом доме, комната через комнату хозяйки, очень некомфортно, через стены все слышно. Не рекомендую. Неприятное впечатление. Great homey feel and hospitality! I don\\'t recommend Good value for the price, good for a single night. Jen was welcoming and kind. Very noisy though All good in the room for the price. Quite tidy and clean. Just be cautious of the hosts in terms of asking for extra cash for some random reason - for me, they said i was not responding on Airbnb app after booking and they had to call on my international number to confirm when i was reaching, and the calls were $15. I had to pay this in cash to them apart from the fees that i paid through Airbnb, which was pretty disappointing.\\n\\nAlso, there are kids in the house who have to get ready like around 6-7am so it might get a bit noisy, but that wasn\\'t much of an issue for me. Overall, a decent place to crash for a short night. Exactly as expected. Great place to stay close to the airport. Jennifer was very nice and hospitable. The room was great and I got a good night of sleep. I loved the fact that it was extremely easy to check in. The apartment was great! Paul was very easy to communicate with. The location is fantastic, right by the train a great deal for the price. The place was clean and stylish, and check-in and out was very easy. I will be coming back to stay again and would recommend it to anyone visiting New York! Nice location, subway is very accessible, however to my knowledge, the booking said nothing about other guests, and there were about five other rooms filled with guests and only one bathroom, so there was always a line to use it. Great quiet place. Really tranquil neighborhood. Close to subway station. Great location and space to stay whilst in the city. I didn\\'t meet Paul during my stay but he responded very quickly to my messages and was super helpful answering any questions. Check in was really easy and well explained after booking. The room was as you see in the listing, plus I was able to ask for a clothes railing to hang clothes, comfortable space, perfect for a short trip to the city. The bathroom was clean but often had a bit of a wait as shared between the other rooms in the flat (about 5 or 6)- not a problem if you\\'re not on a tight schedule but something to keep in mind. Location is great and really easy to get to anywhere in the city from. Loved my time here and I would definitely like to come back! Nice stay in a great location. My boyfriend and I really appreciated the quick response time. Our room got very hot the first night, and opening the window didn’t help. We let Paul know and we were quickly helped! It is a shared bathroom, so it could have been cleaner. All-in-all, a great value. Amazing location and really good value! If it wasn\\'t because the check in was a bit confusing and the heater was way too hot, i would have gave five stars. Paul is an extremely helpful host, quick responder and with a great location. Minutes from Central Park, great food and all of the museums you could dream of. We definitely would book again! Really enjoyed my stay in Paul\\'s apartment. The place was right by the train for a quick and easy access to Times Square as well as downtown New York City. There was a desk in the room which was great for doing some work while visiting friends. Will definitely stay again! The house is very nice and well-located. Paul is polite and attentive. I found a mice in the room, the room is just aside the kitchen, there is a pipeline inside the room that makes the weather extremely hot and the 2 fans didn´t make a big difference, the pipeline makes noises all over the night, It was very impossible to sleep for the heat and the noise. The location was perfect, I didn´t meet Paul, there was no towel, no dryer, no cleanning. It wasn´t a nice experience. Is was nice . Great place to stay in a good location. Close to the subway and Central Park. The place was clean and tidy. The room is as you see it in the pictures. Will be starting here again. Great stay with great guest, don’t hesitate to book Great location, very good communication, I recommend this place to visit NYC! Paul’s place is great! Very close to the subway and very convenient. Tons of food places near by would recommend staying with Paul. Good location, a bit noisy because of the cars, good service. nous sommes très déçus.  appartement beaucoup trop cher pour la qualité. 6 chambres dans cet appartement pour une seule salle de bain. Rue bruyante, échaffaudage devant la fenêtre certainement depuis plusieurs années. Odeur de moisi, d\\'urine de renfermé. par contre wifi et machine à café opérationnel\\nà déconseiller Pidan más indicaciones para recoger la llave al menos un día antes de su viaje!!! Location is great in safe neighborhood.  Close to subway line 6. Lots of restaurants,  shops in walking distance. \\nRoom is simple but practical.  Very noisy cuz main traffic road is facing the window.  Bring ear plugs.  Room and room door is next to the stove in the kitchen.  So expect people to wake you up at all times when using the kitchen.  Great to have Keurig coffee machine but useless if you have no coffee k cups.\\nNever met the host. This place is run as a hostel with 6 rooms and no common area,  all share the one bathroom.  Bathroom is totally disgusting.  Don\\'t take a shower unless you have flip flops.  Bring a lot of disinfect lotion. No, I will not stay there again. \\n It was nice staying at Paul‘s for one night! I really liked it that i could do the check in any time! The comunication was very fast and incomplicadet  Wonderful location - just a few blocks from Central Park, safe neighborhood, really close to the subway station. Paul gave great suggestions for things to do in that area and how to get around. Overall the stay was good! Simple, private bedroom with a comfortable bed. The location is unbeatable! Room was very clean. easy contact with host. close to subway. shared bathroom could be a little cleaner, not bad, just not amazing, but To be fair I’m somewhat hard to please when it comes to bathroom cleanliness. Overall I would definitely recommend. El lugar está bueno, pero las indicaciones no son tales y fue complicado conseguir las llaves, ya que no podía contactar al dueño. Appartement calme et bien situé, 2 lignes de métro relativement proches pour aller sur Manhattan ou Brooklyn.\\nLa chambre est partagée avec 3 autres chambres dédiées elles aussi au airbnb.\\nIl est également possible de laisser les bagages le jour de notre départ, ce qui est vraiment super. The rooms are spacious and thanks to the air conditioning and the fans we never got hot. The location ia great since you have 2 subway stations close to the apartment. Central Park is 2 blocks away.\\nThe negative point would be the bathroom which is very very old. Thanksfully despite the other guests we never had to wait or line up to go shower.\\nThe place was quiet and we were not disturbed by the street noise (anyways you’re in New York, expect to hear trafic and a bit of noise!). We slept very well. \\nPaul’s indication were very clear and it was easy to check in.\\nThe girl who cleans and prepares the rooms is very nice! Interesting initial instructions on the location. Overall good experience with a very reasonable price! Would recommend. Paul’s place was the perfect stay in Manhattan, I found it very convenient to get almost everywhere in the city.The space was clean and private and I really appreciated all the information Paul provided before the stay.I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to NYC:)! Great location, but very noisy due to construction. Check in is at a nearby spot, so somewhat inconvenient for our late arrival. Paul runs his Airbnb like a hostel (which is not clear in the listing) with at least 5 bedrooms inside the unit sharing just 1 bathroom. Although Paul is really nice, he cuts major corners on cleanliness. We were there when he flipped our room;  he changed the sheets on our bed but he didn\\'t replace the blanket - all kinds of things clung to it from previous guests and we didn\\'t feel comfortable using it during our extended stay. Everything was dusty and the floors/rug were dirty. The bedroom door didn\\'t actually close (rendering the lock useless) and any of our items could\\'ve been taken at any time. The bathroom, unfortunately, was the worst part. It reeked of waste and was extremely grimy. The state of the shower honestly makes it uncleanable (unless it is replaced) and all the surfaces (especially the floor) were dirty. Be prepared to wait for the bathroom in mornings and evenings. I understand that some things are tough to maintain with so many guests coming and going and we definitely aren\\'t clean freaks... but when the basic stuff (like bed linens and bathroom) are left completely unclean, it doesn\\'t make for a great stay... It was super convenient for our odd and last minute plans! This is a decent place with great connectivity to most of the tourist places. All it takes is around 30 to 45 minutes via metro to reach all major attractions. Room was clean with basic amenities like AC, dresser, decent mattress, dryer etc. Bath room is shared and you may wanna wake up early to get easy access or wake up late. Paul’s place was convenient and close to the subway station. Check in process was easy. Air con was also available in the room which was great. Gut für low budget in new york This is a one bedroom in a 4 bedroom with only one bathroom. A great location. Only a couple blocks to the 6 and q. Fairly quiet and had its own window unit so you could control the air. I recommend this place! El lugar es lo que se ve. Funciona mu bien y vale la pena a por el dinero y comodidad  The apartment has a great location. The other points could be better. At the end it was a good experience. It\\'s really important to read well the mail Paul send you. Easy check in and check out, really great location! Good location in  Manhattan,   while lacking in maintenance and  cleanness in some facilities.  Comfortable,  if it is not overcrowded. Shower was broken and bathroom was dirty. Metro was close. Room was clean and comfortable. Good location, easy to check in and check out. The apartment is in a great location and easy to access. It is for a very affordable price as well, which makes it a good options.\\n\\nWhat was uncomfortable about the stay was the fact the it is very noisy when sleeping in the Blue room by the kitchen, you can hear every cars passing by as well as pedestrians, so it is difficult to sleep. As for the bathroom it is very dirty most of the time and there is a water leak which is wasting a lot of water. Very happy with my stay here.\\nExcellent location - close to everything needed, quick responses to questions and provided with plenty of information before my trip there.\\n\\nThank you! Location was great- but the place seemed a little yucky. Room was satisfactory Great location, close to subway, easy to reach downtown and Central Park. Clean and simple room. Kitchen and bathroom require a renovation. There is only one bathroom for six rooms, you may queue sometimes. La descripción es tal cual, recomendado muy buen ubicación, buena experiencia! I consider this as a pay-for-lesson experience.\\n\\nThe room is right next to the street and we could hear every single bit of noise from the street as if the window was not closed at all. There were car driving by very frequently even at 3 am in the morning on a weekday and we slept poorly when we stayed there.\\n\\nWe contacted the host for the noise issue and asked if he could check anything and he just responded perfunctorily saying New York is always noisy.\\n\\nI understand that the listed price for my stay was cheap in NYC, however, if I knew about the noise issue I would have never booked it in the first place. Todo muy bien, solo pase frío en las mañanas, la pieza era helada.\\n\\nEverything was great! except the cold room in the morning. Brilliant location you pay for what you get. Only down fall is that it gets really hot in the rooms due to steam system  just make sure you switch air con on as soon as you get there.  Would defiantly return and stay here. Just what I expected & announced, no more, no less. Prompt responsiveness.\\nFlexible check-in time.\\nGreat location.\\nSpacious and cozy room. The apartment has a relatively good location in Manhattan, the price is good in relation to New York prices. The room is private, the rest is shared, the shower has a water leak. The apartment is very well located. we could do everything we needed in the surrounding area. This is what made me give 5 stars, because de apartment is very old and two things annoyed me: the bathroom\\'s tap doesn\\'t close completely, so it keeps falling water 24h a day, and the room was always very hot. \\nAs I said, it\\'s still worth it for the price you pay on this very expensive NY area. La relación calidad precio es de lo mejor , no esperes lujos pero si lo necesario para pasar una noche cómoda , está bien comunicado y hay muchas rutas de transporte muy cerca , parada de Bus a solo unos pasos , vecindario muy tranquilo y seguro . An affordable place to crash. Reliable hosts. Bring sheets and towels as the listing indicates.  This place is perfect for my need. If you travel alone, you might find a companion to help you getting around the city. \\nDont expect you get a 5* facilities. If you need just a place to crash at night, this is the one. Couldnt find a place like\\n Atenção a esta hospedagem, fiquei muito frustrado quando encontrei o local \\nNão havia ninguém para recepcionar os clientes.\\nO local estava sujo e fedia por toda parte,\\nA louça permaneceu suja na pia desde o dia que cheguei até o dia que fui embora da hospedagem,\\na infraestrutura oferecida, era precária, a geladeira estava imunda, parecia que não era limpa há meses. Não havia varal para que pudéssemos estender as toalhas ou roupas molhadas. Toalhas essas que não são fornecidas pelo hostel, você deve trazer a sua, assim como travesseiro e suas roupas de cama.\\na segurança do local era mínima, pois quando cheguei a porta ja estava aberta, por isso fiquei com receio que levassem minha coisas, tanto é que o cadeado que levei comigo e tranquei minha mala, depois que eu cheguei na hospedagem, não abriu mais porque acho que tentaram abrir.\\nenfim, foi muito ruim a experiência, para tanto no segundo dia, me mudei para outro hotel, porque não queria ficar mais ali. \\nEnfim por todos esses contratempos e frustrações e por ter gerado em mim uma grande preocupação logo no primeiro dia viagem eu sinalizo pra você que está buscando um lugar pra ficar, que este talvez não seja o ideal pra você.\\nNeste não há segurança, e condições básicas de higiene e limpeza; este local é pra alguém que quer passar 1 noite e já sair no outro dia, tipo, só um lugar pra dormir mesmo e que não espera nenhum luxo.\\nAté as pessoas que lá estavam eram estranhas.\\nEu nunca mais voltarei a este lugar. Much worse than what one can expect! 8 ppl no ac and one toilet! God Bless me! very difficult place to live. Muy bien conectado si llegas al aeropuerto Laguardia , el barrio muy tranquilo y seguro . Muy buena relación calidad precio It is ok if you need sleep somewhere for few days and you don’t want to spend a lot of money. But you don’t want live there for long time :) Thanks you!!\\nGood host!! This place completely exceeded my expectations given its price point. the apartment is immaculately clean it is cheaper than any Airbnb that I have stayed in and much cleaner than most Airbnb that I have stayed in on the lower end of the price Spectrum. Everything went fine! The room itself was pretty clean, but no bed linen, but that wasn’t a problem. It’s good for spending nights there, cause it’s supposed you’re going to be outside. Everything is provided. The area itself is safe and easy to reach by public transport. I recommend that place if you want a place to sleep and plane  you trip. Very close to Laguardia and good connection to the Manhattan. If you are willing to bring your own sleeping bag, it is probably the best price you can pay! Awesome place & people. Creo que precio calidad está bien. Pero podría estar un poco más limpio. a place to stay before my flight next day. exactly as the description. host is friendly. Good for quick sleep.  You need to bring pillow, blanket and amenities as the host mentioned. Cheap and efficient. Melhor relacao custo/beneficio de N.York. The location was good and it was clean Easy and good stay. Excellent place to stay in NYC. There are minor problems though (mainly commhnication issues). However if you put in a tiny bit of effort, host does a really good job at solvong your problems. She is also really caring about the quality of your stay and does her best to ensure your comfort. 9/10. Would definely book again. Sophia and Sergio were great hosts! Sergio kept the place sparkling clean and both of them were very understanding. The apartment location is less than a min from Central Park walking and the area is beautiful and trendy. I very much enjoyed my stay here! Very nice and clean airbnb. Close to subway and town. Sofia and Sergio very helpful. It was very comfortable to stay at Sergio and Sophia, and the communication were really good and on point. It was very clean and good aircondition! It was also really nice that it was two bathrooms. I really recommend these host.  Wonderful place to stay next to a great park to  Great location, great value. Clean and modern. Would definitely book again.  It’s a very nice place and room, with every basic things you need. The location is wonderful, near central Park West and a lot of places to go out and eat. The Subway station os nearby La comunicación con Sofia antes de nuestra llegada siempre fue muy buena, responde muy rápido y está al pendiente de nosotros. Dentro del departamento,  Sergio fue muy amable durante nuestra estancia. Solid spot The place is in a good location on MANHATTAN, that was very important for me, just a block from Central Park. The apartment is clean and maintained, looks like recently was renovated, there are two bathrooms! \\n\\nThe room itself was small but private with AC. \\nIt was pretty noisy sometimes because of the water pipes system in the walls, I recommend taking earplugs for those who cannot sleep with noise. I am among these people actually, but the noise of AC was monotonous and I fell asleep pretty well. \\n\\nOverall, the experience is good, I got what I needed for a great price!\\n Spartanisch, kleines, aber ausreichendes Zimmer.\\nMan sollte sich bewusst sein, dass 4-5 weitere AirBnB-Doppelzimmer in der Wohnung vermietet werden und man eher das Gefühl von einem Hostels hat. Die Bäder wurden leider weder vor noch während des Aufenthalts gesäubert. Zeitnahe Antworten während des Aufenthaltes waren leider vom Host nicht gegeben. \\nDie Wohnung ist verkehrstechnisch gut angebunden. Einkaufsmöglichkeiten sind fussläufig erreichbar und der Central Park ist für Morgenläufe sehr schnell zu erreichen. It was a nice stay and the area is pretty, just right next to the Central Park! We did not meet Sofia and Sergio but communication was easy. There were other airbnb guests but since there were two shared bathroom it was not a problem at all. Thanks for the nice stay! Convenient. Clean. La ubicación es fantástica, a un minuto del central park y muy bien comunicado por metro, bus y bici. El anfitrión entrañable Location is undeniably great, but we overall didn\\'t have a good (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication and information wasn\\'t proactive, there was dirty towels/linens in the common area throughout our stay, the blocked toilet wasn\\'t addressed quickly, there weren\\'t sufficient cooking basics provided like a kettle, and the apartment was stuffy made worse by the burning of incense. Compared to other AirBnB\\'s we\\'ve stayed in and we saw in NYC, we didn\\'t feel Sofia\\'s place offered value for money. Sergio and Sofia were very helpful and very quick to answer queries or requests. Fantastic location for a New York break and excellent value. Would stay again. Recomiendo al 100% este apartamento, el lugar es muy bueno, barrio seguro, cerca al metro, buses y demás. Sergio nos atendió muy bien y el cuarto excelente. Espero volver. Apartment nice and clean in close proximity to central park and the subway. El apartamento está bien ubicado con respecto a los servicios de transporte y lugares de interés turístico. Es acogedor y limpio. El mejor trato y ubicación! The place is clean but basic. Our room had issues with the window and cold air was blowing through two gaps into the room (not exactly ideal as the weather gets colder). Spoke to Sergio about it who promised to do something to rectify the problem.\\n\\nSomething else noteworthy is that there are 4 other rooms in the apartment which are also rented to Airbnb guests and you will be sharing with them. Do yourself a favour and DO NOT BOOK HERE\\nThe only decent thing about this place was its location as it\\'s a block from Central Park (upper west side)\\nI was driving down from Canada, planning to leave at some point throughout the night, Sofia refused to give me the full address and instructions to get in until I gave her an arrival time\\nWhen she did give me the address she mentioned not wanting us to speak to anyone about airbnb as they are not allowed to do short-term rentals in their building\\nI messaged the hosts to ask about whether or not there was an iron for us to use at the apartment, Sofia did not reply until we were already driving down\\nTheir description of their apartment makes it sound as if you are staying in a spare room of their apartment, when really all the other rooms are also rented out to other airbnb guests, making it feel like a hostel rather than an airbnb\\nSharing with all these people also made the bathroom situation difficult as there were two bathrooms but only one of them sort of worked. One bathroom had the toilet sealed off, making it unable to use and the shower head for that same bathroom wouldn\\'t turn on. The other bathroom\\'s tub water stopper would not work properly and the tub almost overflowed multiple times; one of the other guests managed to fix it the first time. Sergio was there when the tub was filling up the first time and did nothing about it. I had messaged the hosts twice about the tub as we needed to shower, the first time I didn\\'t get a response until the next day, the last time Sofia replied AFTER our check out time, even though we ended up leaving to a hotel a day early anyways as we needed a working bathroom and nothing was being done about ours\\nAlso, because the tub kept raising with water and it wasn\\'t cleaned well, residue would rise as well and float around in the tub\\nThe bed linens had also clearly not been washed as there was fairly recent make up and crumbs on them\\nThe room smelt funny when we arrived\\nThe window has gaps in it as well, so the cold October air would get in; there was a thermostat in the bedroom but it didn\\'t work. We were lucky we had brought our own blanket\\nOverall, a bad experience at Sofia and Sergio\\'s place. You could get a lot better apartments in NYC. I would highly not recommend staying here Location is close to the subway and Central Park. Other rooms available if you need more room. Hopefully bathroom issues have now been resolved, I notice a lot of other reviews have mentioned them (toilets and slow draining bath, we also couldn’t get second shower to work). Would be worth topping up soap in the bathroom sink, and maybe providing a kettle for guests to use. Very basic but value for money. Our bedroom was clean. An okay place for anyone just looking for a place to rest their head at night. Be aware, this is more a hostile than a private bedroom. You will be sharing the space with other guests and sharing a community bathroom. If you are looking to just get out and explore all day (which we did) then you can make it work just fine. We did however try to avoid going back until we were sure we would be going to bed. There was also quite a bit of noise at night so if you have troubles with any noise then make sure to take some sleeping aids. Pros:\\n- Great location\\n- Communication upfront was good\\n- Easy checkin and checkout\\n\\nCons:\\n- Very basic room with little comfort (literally only a bed with thin pillows and an unstable bedside table)\\n- Bathrooms were neither cleaned before we arrived nor while we were there - pictures and room description suggested a clean place\\n- Towels were only provided after we’ve asked twice for it late at night\\n- There was a hot water pipe in our room that was extremely noisy in the morning and evening (earplugs highly recommended)\\n- There are two bathrooms that are shared with 3 other bedrooms in the apartment - bathrooms ran also out of soap and toilet paper while we were there\\n\\nOverall we would rather call this place a hostel than an AirBnB as there are quite a few other people in the apartment and the standard in the rooms is quite low compared to similar places we’ve booked before (also in New York). It was a cheap place in a good location and if you don’t mind a dirty bathroom this is your place. We personally would not book again. Good location Great place to stay in the city. Apartment was very clean. Everything we needed was there and loved the small kitchenette. Host was very attentive and accommodated the space for my small children. Would stay there again.  Nice little place. Angelica was an amazing host Pristine space, extremely timely responses and easy check-in, more than enough personal space! Amazing value. Can’t recommend highly enough! Angelica’s place was good, comfortable, quiet place , every amenities is new, clean and near the subway station. I unfortunately didn’t meet her but she host very good response very quick. I will recommend my friend to stay with Angelica’ place Book this place! very close to Subway, kitchen appliances, comfy room!   Amazing experience.  Nice flat, clean and comfy !  Simple and accesible accomodstions. Toilet was clogged and there was rotten food in the fridge. Lindo lugar y muy cómodo, muy buena ubicación y Angélica muy buena anfitrión recomendable alojamiento\\n The apartment was easy to find train station was a block or two anyway and good walking distance !! Appartement très propre idéalement situé a deux pas d\\'une station de métro desservant tout le sud de Manhattan ! \\nAngelica est très réactive aux messages et répond aux attentes ! Je recommande sans hésiter ! \\n\\n This is a great affordable alternative to a hotel in NYC. The room was quiet and comfortable. So glad to have A/C in muggy 90 degree weather. Very accessible by MTA;  30 minutes from Penn Station for example. Would stay here again! Great Harlem location near subway. Clean rooms, kind host! Good price nice place  No el mejor ni muy bueno pero si decente y solo para dormir  Whilst we did not meet Angelica in person, she was a very accommodating host! She responded to all our messages quickly and we were able to drop our bags off before check-in and leave them in the apartment after we had checked-out, ready to pick up later that day. The room is as described with a comfortable bed and everything was clean and tidy. The air-con unit is quite loud but was a welcome addition to the room after a long day in the city! The location is great (5 mins walk to subway and about 15/20mins direct to Times Square). We would definitely stay here again if we are ever back in New York! The privacy was great. Room and apartment was clean. If this place is open, BOOK IT while you can!! The flat could not have been in a better location, and was just as lovely it looks in the photos. She was very accommodating with our check-in schedule, and allowed us to drop off our bags there in the morning after our red-eye flight while we explored Manhattan. Angelica was a  great host. Excellent location for exploring, eating, shopping, and Angelica always available for any questions, routing, or just for a chat. Angelica was an amazing host for my first time to New York. The room was stylish, clean and comfy. The kitchenette had all the essential amenities. The doors were a bit difficult to open the first time, but that was more on my end and Angelica sent a speedy response with video instructions on how to open the doors. She checked up on us which I thought was a nice touch. There is a school across the street, but the only noise I heard was from a tour group and that was only once in four days. Either than that, pretty tame street walking distance to the subway and convenient stores. I would definitely recommend her room... Thank you again Angelica. Le logement proposé par Angelica est bien situé dans Harlem mais je n y serais pas allee seule en tant que jeune femme si je prevoyais de rentrer tard la nuit.\\nIl n est qu à 15 mn de downtown ce qui est tres appreciable. \\nLe logement etait un peu petit a notre goût et en basement ou sous-sol et donnait sur les poubelles. Nous n avons donc pas ouvert les fenetres.\\nC etait agreable d avoir une climatisation meme si extremement bruyante.\\nLa cuisine etait trop petite pour en tout 6 personnes, puisque l autre chambre etait prise par quatre personnes.\\nLes lieux etaient assez propres. \\nCe logement est pratique si vous passez la plupart de votre temps dehors a la decouverte de NYC et si vous aimez partager les lieux avec des inconnus. good Here are a few important details that are missing from them description:\\n\\n(1) Contrary to what the description implies, the host does not seem to actually live in this flat. I assume it\\'s being used for short-term rentals exclusively. During our time there, other renters stayed in the second room and we would share the bathroom and the kitchen with them. The bathroom was not cleaned during that time, so of course hair and other dirt accumulated over time.\\n\\n(2) Below the flat lies a basement in which people living in the house do their laundry. The only way to get to that basement seems to be *through* Angelica\\'s flat. So expect even more strangers walking through the hallway.\\n\\n(3) During our second night, someone was apparently doing some midnight laundry, because around 12:30 a.m., the washing machine started to literally jump around in the basement (defective, not correctly leveled - whatever) making lots of noise. We woke up because of it and texted Angelica, asking her in a very friendly way to take care of this. Her reply she sent the next day was completely unhelpful in that it didn\\'t even touch the issue. Instead, we received the exact same standard sentence we had already seen the other day when we arrived.\\n\\nI can definitely not recommend staying at this flat. Great place to say. Great access to the city. Host was very responsive to communications. Buena llegada al metro y al city bus. Tranquilo. Es amable y para paseos cortos está bien Good place to crash Clean room with comfortable bed. Suited for people just wishing to sleep well during the night and visit the city during the day. We recommend this place! That place just like I expected and it was clean and a nice spot to relax 10 minutes before I was set to check in with Angelica, she sent a  text telling me the place wouldn’t be cleaned until later.  I had all of my bags in tow .. needing a place to change and relax for a little while before my meetings. This put me in a huge bind and winded up having to cancel last minute to look for another Air bnb.  Horrible First experience :-( O local é lindo, você percebe um cuidado com tudo. Todos os cômodos impecáveis, bem limpos, roupas de cama e banho cheirosas, espaço agradável. Ótima localização, muito próximo do metrô mesmo, fácil acesso para Times Square e Wall street, possui mercado e Mc donalds próximo, quanto a segurança o local é tranquilo, chegamos de madrugada e foi bem (Website hidden by Airbnb) certeza me hospedaria novamente sem pensar duas vezes. Ah! Levei meus pais junto e eles adoraram! Great place! This place is cool, clean, and perfect to stay in. It was almost 100 degrees outside while I was there and I couldn’t tell. Everything was immaculate! You could eat off the floors (if you’re into that type of thing) Everything is brand new and I appreciated the TV hook ups with Netflix preloaded. The response was extremely quick and accommodations out of this world. I will definitely stay again. Great place to stay while in NYC! Would recommend it to everyone! We had a great time at Jimmys apartment. It is close to the subway and the A-train drive straight to Manhattan (25-30min). We never met jimmy but he always respond quickly by message or call. We only had one issue with the keypad downstairs. The keypad is broken and you have to ring somebody else ring to get into the building. But a lot of people in the house are awake late at night. Don’t get me wrong, the house is still quite. \\nOverall, it was great and we would come back. Jimmy and his friends were wonderful hosts.  We communicated by text and they were responsive and helpful.  The apartment was just perfect for the four of us;  clean and new, with lots of natural light.  \\n\\nThe neighborhood lacks restaurants and parks, but it\\'s a quick walk to the subway, with trains to Manhattan, other parts of Brooklyn, and Queens. Unterkunft mit kleinen Problemen. The apartment is clean and well located, just a few minutes away from subway. There are a supermarket and some Delis around. We didn\\'t met Jimmy, because of the self-check-in, but he always replied very quick to our e-mails. The apartment is perfekt for a New York trip, we had a very good time there.  Nice modern apartment Jimmy\\'s place was great for our family vacation to NYC. The Metro is a short walk away and gave us access to Manhattan in roughly 30 minutes.  There is one room of bunk beds...and one room with a double bed, kitchen and bathroom. Tv\\'s in both bed rooms. An elevator in the building was nice since the apartment is on the 3rd floor. We basically just used the apartment for sleeping and it met all of our needs. Clean flat, only 10mn walk from Broadway Junction subway station (3 different lines leading to Manhattan in 15/20mn).\\nSome kitchen equipment needs to be added to allow dinner cooking. Everything was great! I’ll start by saying this place exceeded my expectations. I was a little concerned about the neighborhood. It was a bit off putting and I wasn’t sure how safe it would be. I was also concerned about the parking. We arrived close to midnight and the street parking was limited. I messaged the host about parking and couldn’t believe how quickly he responded especially since it was so late. I found parking one block over. I dropped my kids and hubby off at the door and walked back to the apartment alone at night. I was fine and no one bothered me. My car was fine too. This place is really close to the subway  but we decided to Uber everywhere. The ride into Time Square is between $25-$40 depending on the time of day. The place itself is very clean, modern and looks just like the pictures. There are AC units in all the rooms so be sure to look behind the curtains. The towels were nice and fluffy and there was a hair dryer. The street does get a little noisy so if you’re a light sleeper you may want to pack ear plugs. After midnight I don’t remember hearing any noise though. The Netflix TV was so nice especially for winding down and keeping the kids entertained while we got ready to go out. Overall, this place is great! I recommend this place to everyone.  The apartment was a good base if you planned on being out for the majority of the time and not actually spending much time there. It was very bare, there weren’t many utensils in the kitchen if you planned using it to cook meals. There weren’t any hand towels or bath mats provided, and hosts did not respond to messages about this or provide any. The pillows were thin, lumpy and uncomfortable, host did not respond to message about this. For a week stay there weren’t enough towels, however host did supply some more of these quickly upon request. A major issue was the bunk beds in the second room. They were not designed for adults to sleep in. Although the mattresses were very comfortable, the bed frame itself shook and creaked constantly and loudly through the night even at small movements. \\nOverall the home was spacious and clean but needs a few adjustments to be five star. Would stay again if these adjustments were made. Thanks for a great stay First the good:\\nThe place is exactly like the pictures. \\nJimmy answered very quickly\\nIt was OK clean\\nGreat to have TV with Netflix\\nThe place can only be booked for 4 adults and Jimmy didn\\'t mind we also had our two year old (she slept in the bed with us)\\n\\nThe not so good:\\nThe area is not great and it doesn\\'t have good food choices nearby.\\nStreet is noisy, and on the second night there was party at the building behind, although that is not the hosts fault it\\'s worth to mention as it was impossible to sleep (could hear the music loud and clear)\\nThere was no hand towel. Our stay with jimmy was beyond wonderful. The place clean and new remodel. Jimmy was as great host he was quick to respond to our message and made sure we was well situated and have  everything we need for our stay.. thank you for hosting us will definitely stay there again if I am ever in the city. Jimmy’s Place was neat and tidy. Jimmy was a great host, the apartment was very clean and well located. It was 5 min walk from the subway station. I highly recommend staying at his apartment. Thank you Jimmy! The apartment is freshly remodeled, close to  C and L train lines. Very clean appartement and easy check-in. There is also lot of places for parking. Definitely recommended. Communication with Jimmy and Julia was great. They both responded very quick to all my messages. The appartment is exactly what it looks like in the pictures. Check-in was a self check-in and we did not see the hosts, which did not bother us. However the appartment was not cleaned properly before we came, it had had a very quick clean and it was simply dirty in several areas of the appartment. We expressed this to Jimmy who immediately gefundeerd our cleaning fee and promised to send the cleaners again, unfortunately this did not happen. Also look closely to the area of the appartment before you book it. Lovely Space! Looks exactly like the pictures. Close to trains so very public trans friendly. Hosts made check-in and check-out process very smoothly. Definitely would recommend for a stay in Brooklyn. Thanks! Would stay again Nice and clean apartment room Great place, \\nLocation was amazing, \\ncheck in and out was extremely easy \\nwould recommend for anyone looking for a great place to stay in brooklyn \\njimmy was available to answer all inquiries in a timely matter Really nice place just a while for the oven to come on and the plumbing is on the opposite side Really clean apartment and totally recommended it. The price was  excellent m Jimmy is a great communicator, he is also great at attempting to solve any problems you may have. I don\\'t know if it is AirBNB policy but be sure to come prepared to have everything you need, even simple things you don\\'t think of, such as a bottled water or paper towels. Amazing home, small but cozy! Neighborhood is quiet. Clean apartment.  Fast access to the subway, great coffee place nice and close. Make sure to bring towels! The area is not too desirable, but it\\'s a good place to stay with a group. Close to multiple metro stations and comfortable overall. Staying with Alice’s mother, Alexandra, was wonderful! \\nHer apartment is on a corner 1 block away from Central Park, and about 10 minutes walking distance from the nearest metros, so it’s a great location. It’s in upper Manhattan, so you’re not RIGHT next to the main attractions of NYC, but it’s quieter and easy to navigate your way around.\\nAlexandra is a very sweet woman who greeted us on our arrival around 11 am. She generously gave us access to her kitchen, her coffee makers (with really yummy coffee) and offered us a few recommendations to start our trip! \\nShe also has one ADORABLE dog and two cats- so if you have allergies, you might want to be careful, however my girlfriend is allergic to cats and didn’t experience any symptoms. \\nOverall, we loved interacting with Alexandra, and enjoyed our stay at her Airbnb! Would definitely stay again if we’re ever in the city. The room was very clean and the host was very friendly, as were her cats and dog.  It was in a great location next to central park and easy to reach everywhere by bus or subway.  This is a great place to stay in New York. Although it is slightly distant from downtown, it is really close to Central Park and subway stations. The place is a little tight, but it’s good for what you pay compared to other spots in New York. I would definitely recommend staying here because the host was very nice and friendly and gave us tips on great local spots to check out!\\n(This was no problem for me but just an FYI that there are pets- a small dog and a cat.)\\nOverall, it was a good pick.  Private bedroom with AC and a fan, and a comfy bed. Bathroom was right next to the bedroom. Typical NYC apartment with compact spaces and trendy décor. No hassle and very helpful! I would recommend staying here if you are looking for a place on the West-side!   Great location a block from Central Park which was the reason I chose this location. Great communication and responses and would certainly recommend to other guests traveling to New York. A few pros to this place are that the apartment is in a really safe location and it is beautiful, and the pets were the sweetest animals ever. Sadly, the cons outweighed the pros. We were supposed to be given access to the whole apartment, including the kitchen, and free breakfast, and wifi, but instead we were confined to one area with a bedroom and bathroom. The rules made by the host were ridiculous, one of them being that we could not shower past 10 pm and the other being that we could not use the kitchen water and instead had to drink the bathroom sink water. This experience is not what the listing describes it as but it is worth the cheap price of $60. I, personally, would not stay here again. Our hostess was nice and very accommodating. This bedroom in a private apartment is a great value. It\\'s not in the part of town I usually spend time in -- but it\\'s very convenient to the subway. It\\'s a small room--but it\\'s right next to the apartment door, which is right near the building entrance; and the bathroom is immediately next to your room, which enhances privacy. The host is charming and helpful. I chose this place mainly for the value and that\\'s still its outstanding feature. Good location, amenities provided ! What we needed! Appartement très bien situé, proche du métro et de Central Park. Séjour agréable en compagnie d\\'Alexandra et des animaux. A good location very near Central Park but very dusty and cat/ dog hair all over the room. Lots of dust. Good to just crash for the night as it\\'s a very small room and not very clean. We had a little difficulty entering the main building as the host had to leave on an urgent basis. ( waited outside about 15 mins till the next occupant opened the main door). Communication from the host was prompt, WiFi was quite slow.  Very near to Subway Station.... but the cons outweigh the pros... À signaler : présence d’animaux (chien et chats), pas de possibilité d’utiliser la cuisine, hôte travaillant sur place (tranquillité à respecter et horaires pour les douches), 2 ème chambre occupée par d’autres locataires (salle de bain commune)\\n\\nPoints positifs : proche de Central Park, proche de plusieurs lignes de métro, quartier sûr, réactivité aux messages et hôte parlant français/anglais The location is nice. The apartment is a little cluttered because it’s a family home. The room is VERY small, our two carry-ons barely fit between the bed and wall. \\nAnd the house is very cluttered, the entire kitchen was not usable. Additionally, the host is not very friendly person. She scolded me for using the microwave when she was apparently conducting business on the phone in the kitchen on a Saturday morning. She later came and sort of apologized but mainly just told us she has to work on Saturday\\'s. I respect that but felt she could have done that in her room or I recommend that she not have guests in her house.   I feel heating coffee that I ran to dunkin donuts to get was not out of line.  First time I stayed somewhere that didn\\'t offer coffee or have coffee already made.  Bottom line. I felt safe in the neighborhood but not welcomed in this home. Alice’s friend was really nice with me, and helped me with all my requests. The department was clean and really near to Central Park and subway stations. Location is great, safe area. Very small room but right beside the bathroom which made it practical. Barebones room and washroom. Muy cerca y accesible para visitar NY Hello,\\nWe were greeted by Alice\\'s mother, who was always friendly with us.\\nBut the whole house is very dirty and messy, definitely not able to host other people. The room is very small, but okay, the bed is very uncomfortable and I do not know what it has, but it is not a mattress. Despite the good location, I definitely do not recommend it. The Apartment wasn’t really clean. Especially the smell in the bathroom was horrible because of the cat toilet in there. The cat and the dog jumped on the bedsheet all the time. So the bedsheet wasn’t that clean at all. Moreover Iam allergic to cats and with all the hair at the bedsheet I couldn’t sleep there comfortable. I think this is a point should named in the description of the room. I was happy to stay there not longer than one night. \\nThe location nice and easy to finde. We felt save in this area. Communication was easy and Alice mother was really kind. The host canceled this reservation 48 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Me and my friend had an excellent time Yuri\\'s apartment. It was sparkling clean and it served its purpose to provide a place to sleep after long days of exploring Manhattan. The location was conveniently located next to the subway station, so we had an easy time going midtown and lower Manhattan. It\\'s also really close to Central Park, 30 mins walking distance, so it was great. It was also a very safe place. Totally recommend. First night was a bit shaky, but overall it was a comfortable and peaceful stay. Perfect for anyone traveling alone and is just looking for a place to rest up. \\n\\nVery close to the subway for an easy commute to just about anywhere. Also, not a ton of fast food/carry out options. However there are great food stores near  by if you’re in the mood to cook and save a few bucks. :) I most definitely was\\n(even bought a spatula for the house)\\n\\nYari keeps the place very clean, peaceful and comfortable so don’t be rude and make things harder on her.\\n\\nWould definitely book again on a one person trip if she would have me. The apartment was very clean and a great value. Though it is far from central manhattan the apartment is a very close and easy walk to the metro. There is also a bus that picks up and drops off near by that goes to the terminals at LaGuardia airport. The apartment is on the first floor so street noises can be heard at night. There are multiple rooms rented to Airbnb but for the most part there is not interaction with other guests. Overall the stay was great, I would recommend for anyone looking for a basic but clean and comfortable place to sleep in the city. Great stay Yari’s place is the best Hôtesse disponible à toute heure. Nous sommes arrivées très tard et Yari a pu nous aider à nous installer. Le logement est propre, grand et facilement accessible.  Quatre chambres individuelles. \\nLa ligne 1 est située à deux pas de l\\'appartement et mène directement à Time Square. \\nAttention cependant lors des sorties nocturnes. Le quartier m\\'a semblé peu safe aux heures tardives. Idéal pour séjour court. Super convenient being that I travel into the city for work! Very clean and private room and Yari is great with communication and check in/out. Everything was perfect! Overall the experience was ok.  The place was clean.   I liked that there seemed to be cleaning daily.  I did not fully understand that this was a 4 unit space and there was probably 12 people sharing 1 bathroom.  This became a timing issue a time or two. Yari e\\' stata precisissima e velocissima nelle risposte. Sempre raggiungibile. La stanza non male, ma niente di eccezionale, molto basilare (letto semplice con copertina e cuscini). Casa troppo grande, 5 stanze con troppe persone che inevitabilmente provocano non molta pulizia negli spazi comuni e portano rumorosita\\'. Ad ogni modo consigliato per piccole soste (2-3gg massimo). Nice place to say in the city. Excelente anfitriona! La cama y las almohadas son muy cómodas. Limpieza en las habitaciones. Lo necesario para descansar tu hospedaje. I love staying here! Yari is a great host! Yari is a nice host. She\\'s very responsive, too. however, she might want you to pretend you are staying in the apt (as her roommates), since the land lord was not very happy with his/her air bnb business - this was within my expectation If you\\'re into the whole New York vibe right in the middle of Spanish Harlem this is the perfect spot. I felt right at home (city girl.) It was easy to travel (the train was literally across the street.) Oh let me not forget super clean and the restaurant next door had some good Mexican food and wasn\\'t expensive. The room was perfect if you just going to be in the city and need somewhere to sleep. It was enough room for my son and I. Thanxxx Yari. Room was clean but building and neighborhood did not feel that safe. Yari was available when needed and helped me out to find the building. Good location in a decent space. The bathroom situation is way less than ideal; feels like a icky wet public bath house. Could use some small tweaks for a more comforting stay. La ubicación del departamento esta buena ya que es cerca del metro, sin embargo fue extraño que la anfitriona nos indicara cuando llegamos que si alguien nos preguntaba dijéramos que no veníamos por airbnb a hospedarnos...\\nLa limpieza del lugar es buena y cumple con lo básico si quieres solo llegar a dormir y ducharte. Location is great and the hosts are friendly, wonderful people. Would definitely stay with them again! They were so nice! I would love to stay with them, love that part of Brooklyn. Very hospitable and accomodating.. I enjoyed my stay at their apartment. the host is  good Our stay was ok, it could have been better but if u need a cheap bed in NYC it\\'s fine! U will have your own bedroom, which is clean enough. The house is not well rennovated and it was a bit too hot in the bedroom. Though the couple (who\\'ll sleep in het living room during your visit) was very talkative and caring! Thanks!! There is very little information in the listing and it\\'s not accurate. This is only appropriate for 420 friendly guests who don\\'t mind strong smell of weed since the host smokes (the host didn\\'t share this in the listing or in person during check in).  I booked it for my husband and myself and we were forced to leave in the middle of the night due to the strong smell of weed coming from the living room. This is 1bdr apt where host lives with his significant other in the living room and rents a bedroom. There is no real access to kitchen since it\\'s a part of the living room. You will get food container instead of a real fridge. There will be no lock on your room from outside so the room will remain open when you step out. This is not kids friendly. Area is not safe after dark. You can expect a really calm and chill experience.  Down to earth hosts who do not get in your way.  Very hospitable and the place was very clean. Location was ok, a bit overpriced for what you get. Cleanliness has to improve! Bedroom is okay We enjoyed our staying  even though we spend only one night at this apartment. The place is quiet and cozy. Guys were very friendly and helpful! Hope to stay there next time. The building is about 15 mins far from the station of subway and they are nice and helpful. Good spot for the amount you pay. Host was also very flexible with our check in and check out. Lovely place and cozy all transportation near by and stores also food i loves how i was greeted This was a nice and quiet place.  The host was kind and offered just enough amenities for us to feel comfortable for the evening.  The room was spacious.  The location was perfect for attending an event at the Kings Theater right around the corner. they wavy A great host and location this is a nice low key place to get away, a home away from home , I had a great time Great host, very accomodating. Make sure to call to set up a meeting time to transfer keys, etc. Might be a little out of the way if you want to be in the middle of Brooklyn. Otherwise, no issues! Make sure you confirm with him a few days before your reservation. Even if you\\'ve already confirmed with him further in advance. Really knows how to keep a customer happy ! I told him I found a bed bug at witch point he told me to leave his house now and he is a aggressive ass on the phone Overall, a fine stay for one night. It was about a 1 mile walk from the Grant Ave subway station. It wasn’t the nicest area around the station but during the day we never felt unsafe. Check-in was a confusing process and there was no information prior to our arrival. No information about check out either. The apartment was COLD when we first got in, and even though we turned on the heater, it never warmed up past 65. Be aware that the bed only has one sheet and no duvet/comforter to keep you warm at night. There was only one towel and blanket, and no extra pillows for those sleeping on the couch to use. The host was happy to have us. Again, fine for one night but could have been better. Great, welcoming, friendly, and generous host! Clean and very accommodating! Will come back in future. It’s a dope spot. Just need to be really cleaned out and appliances should be plugged and ready to use.. but overall was a nice stay. Very comfortable. Felt welcomed.Clean.\\nMet my expectations. Had such a wonderful time staying at Fabio\\'s place. Easy check-in amazing location. Very clean spacious apartment. Would definitely stay here again. Good place if you want privacy & comfort. Thank you for the great Hospitality! good bedroom really large in a perfect position Fabio has a quiet and clean house. Comfortable and private. Good host and cohost. Safe environment and very clean Warm welcome and cozy They were very nice hosts with a very clean and spacious home. At First glance of my stay they made it impossible to check in and I had to wait for 2-3 hours to accommodate them while I was supposed to be the one accommodated. The place isn’t nearly worth the price. No Heating, No Cable tv in bedroom only living room. Stained pots and pans. No Closet. Also a rush while checking out was a pain to again accommodate the host. Beautiful, minimalist apartment in a lovely part of town. Fabio is an eminently kind and gracious host. I cannot recommend more highly. Amazing! Great location, huge room, super clean and very nice couple hosting. I highly recommend this spot. I booked it last minute not expecting much, but it exceeded my expectations in every way. I would definitely stay again. Nice room in clean appartment. The hosts are very welcoming. Great apartment in brilliant location. Very clean, welcoming and the bedroom is a really good size. Fabio is a very nice, helpful host. Highly recommend. Great place to stay! Great Leona’s place was very clean and looked just like the pictures. Nice safe space in a great location! Communication was very easy and I always heard back within minutes. Highly recommend booking this place. Very nice room in a perfect location. Leona\\'s room was super cute and looked exactly as described. The space was neat, and the location was extremely close to fun restaurants, central park, and public transportation. Would definitely recommend it to anyone coming to visit NYC. 1. The water while taking a shower is extremely irregular. I burned myself twice because the water keeps changing to either extremely hot or extremely cold.\\n2. There is a cleaning fee for the stay, however, the guest is expected to clean their own dishes after use, clean the shower, etc. So why pay the cleaning fee? \\n3. It is extremely hard to enter with the key that is provided. It gets stuck and is hard to open the entrance. I had great time at Leona and Renee’s apartment. They are fantastic hosts, quick response, well-organized and prepared. The room is spacious and super clean. There are many nice restaurants, bars and supermarkets around the neighborhood. The subway is 5 mins by walking. I highly recommend the place to others. I will definitely come back again. Thank you Leone and Renee. Don’t Go !!!!!!!!!! The stuido is nice and clean and the advantage of this stuido is it\\'s close to the main st. Good place for quick stay. Near airport. Zach promptly communicates, and the studio apartment is close to train and subway stations It was as expect. Very nice host. Good for short stay Just what I needed for a weekend food excursion in Flushing! Worth every penny. Taz is an AMAZING host, answers immediately, super nice, awesome person. The place is perfect for someone who just needs a place to sleep. Its clean, has all the basic needs, and its cozy. However, its a bit noisy because its in the first floor, but its better than staying in plain times square! The location is awesome too. A Starbucks a block away, near Hells Kitchen so theres plenty of places to eat, and just a few minutes away from Times Square. Will definitely stay here again if given the chance! Taz was great. He answered my questions via text quickly and was very nice when I misunderstood how his key system worked. Room is large and the location was perfect. 3 minute walk to Times Square and 15 to Rockefeller Center. 10/10 Would book again. I had an emergency and booked his place at the very last minute. He’s very understanding and personally helped me check-in at 10:30pm! Overall, great place, great host and great location! Fantastic location! Taz was very nice and let us stay later then we should have! However, he was very poor at responding the we had to share a key with another renter. An amazingly convenient apartment in an unbeatable location. The bedroom was simple, nice and clean with plenty of room, and Taz was a super attentive host when it came to communicating the logistics. Adoramos a hospitalidade.\\n\\nTodos que nos receberam foram muito gentis.\\n\\nRecomendamos essa casa tudo que precisa está ao alcance.\\n\\nCongratulations.\\n\\nThank so much. Christopher was really kind and cute. Thanks for hosting us! Heisseel’s  place is not good, it’s AMAZING. Starting with her fast response and going beyond to serve any request. The house is beautiful, very very beautiful. It felt like home, she even has a Christmas tree. The house is extremely clean/organized and a variety of utensils. She’s is very kind and her kids too. My boyfriend and I loved our stay and will book again if traveling to NY again. Thank for everything! Super clean, super friendly host! Great value, & very comfortable rooms. Great neighborhood also. Safe & convenient shopping. Very warm and pleasant host. My friend and I had a good time staying at this place. This was a great last minute reservation that worked out PERFECT!! \\nDEETS:\\n\\n*Easy Check-In \\n*Beautiful Decor\\n*Sparkling Clean \\n*Well Scented Home\\n*Great Communication w/ Host\\n*Large Firm & Comfortable Bunk Bed\\n*Desk Set To Store Your Items & Apply Makeup\\n*Extra Chair\\n*Plenty Of Storage Space For Luggage\\n*Easy Parking\\n*Quiet Neighborhood\\nAll this for a REASONABLE PRICE!! You can\\'t beat this deal! Book your stay and thank me later! No era lo que yo esperaba'"

Be warned because I was woken up several times daily between 12-3am with the other guests coming in and out of the apartment and they have to cross the living room to get to the only bedroom in the apartment. \\n\\nSafety of your valuables and/or luggage is not secure since you are in the living room of a small 1-bedroom apartment with other guests you don’t know. Privacy is very minimal.\\n\\nApartment is on the 4th floor! So if you brought luggage plan on hauling it up and down a narrow set of stairs.\\n\\nOverall, Good deal for the price of a bed in a living room in this area.

       " \"Do yourself a favor and get and airbnb somewhere else. I felt like I was experiencing what NY used to be like back in the day. On cold nights, not having a heater will make you sleep with both your sweater and a coat, since the blankets are pretty thin. The big lock you get your keys from at the check in might get stuck in the rain. I picked this place, because it said washer and dryer are (in-unit). They are in the basement (this apt. is on the 4th floor w no elevator), and you have to call Taz to let you in. It will not be convenient. I ended up washing my clothes by hand and drying them on the room divider screen by the bed. I wasn't very happy to be doing that. There is no place to put your clothes or anything by the way, not even a coat rack or a drawer. Also, the light weight screen keeps collapsing. The other guest's bed and the screen are right next to you screen, so the guests that stayed in the other bed also had their screen collapsing over my screen. When the screen is open a little wider to just get into your bed or to prevent the screen from collapsing all the time, it gets difficult for the people staying in the room to get through. In the tiny livingroom, there really are two beds, two screens, two lamps, and nothing else. No place to store anything. It didn't exactly feel homey. \\n\\nThe host gave me one towel for all 5 nights of stay. I think the girls staying in the room asked for more towels, and they didn't get more. When they really asked for a heater and they got a small heater, even my livingroom bed was warmer, and I didn't have to sleep with both my sweater and coat on underneath the thin blanket....The kitchen was missing a paper towel (that I wanted to dry your hands after washing your hands, since the bathroom is sometimes shared between 4 ppl) for liek the first 3 nights of my stay. I think he came into the apt. to set up the bed and to take out the trash, but I don't think he was really cleaning anything. The bathroom has mold, and the whole apt. seemed a bit dusty. \\n\\nI had booked an additional night of stay a week in advance via airbnb, but I don't think the host checked my message in time or looked at the guest list thoroughly. He asked me (he did ask me nicely) when I was going to check out on my 2nd to the last day, which made me panic a little, thinking that maybe I didn't have a place to stay that night. That was when I was in the middle of touring Brooklyn. I was stressed. \\n\\nI hope the host will provide some storage place for guest's clothes, at the very least. I think this place is at a good location (although there are other airbnbs in this location) if you are watching shows, but I think the host can put a little more effort to making the place feel like home. Or at the very least, making the place feel comfortable. I really have never stayed at an Airbnb where I had to hang my clothes over the cheapest room divider screens. There are slightly heavier screens for a little more money. Especially with the screens by both my bed and the other guest's bed constantly falling, I did not enjoy that experience of having to hang or dry my clothes (that I have washed by hand) over the screen. \\n\\nSince there are other airbnb postings at similar prices with elevators or cleaner apt or apt with some way of hanging or storing your clothes/stuff, I would like to recommend finding and airbnb elsewhere until this place gets to be a little more like a home people would actually live in.\",\n",

Again, things can happen but the host must be willing to manage the situation properly.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo sum up - Apartment is acceptable but host must improve his attitude towards his guests and establish a backup plan for key handover.\\r\\n\",\n",
       " 'Good points :\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location of the apartament is very very great, Madsion replies very quickly to questions. The flat is well located near times square and penn station. The room is clean, air Conditioning and wifi worked fine. There are many accessories in the apartment (iron, ironing board, umbrella, hair dryer...). The shop \"Brooklyn Fare\" is just on the left when you go out and the products are good.\\r\\n\\r\\nNegative points :\\r\\n\\r\\nBed too small for 2, and the futon is uncomfortable to sleep. The common areas are dirty (especially the bathroom) when the four rooms are occupied. It is impossible that the cleaning lady comes every day or she must be change.\\r\\n\\r\\nPs : Sheets are provided but please bring your own towels.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note that we had trouble when we arrived. The key retrieved in the lock box was not working. Madison did not answer the phone. We had to make do by ourselves to get into the building (thank you to the neighbor).\\r\\n',\n",
       " \"The whole experience was quite terrible. Firstly, the key was not in the box as directed. Had to trek a few blocks to a Starbucks with my luggage, get on WiFi and contact Madison.  After that delay, couldn't open the building's door because of tricky key/loose lock situation. Others had this problem too.  After finally getting into the building with the help offered by a man (not what a single woman wants to have to accept for safety reasons, but I was getting a little desperate by then), and walking up 5 flights of stairs, got to the apartment door, with the neighbours' 2 dogs across the hall yapping incessantly.  They kept that up for hours, each day.  Room itself was unacceptable for the price, with uncovered lightbulb in ceiling for light, plastic bags stuffed around air conditioner as insulation, futon crease encrusted with dirt (hello cleaning lady?) so not touchable, no WiFi password left in room as promised so again required another trek to Starbucks to ask Madison about that, steep and high hike up to a bed with so little clearance for movement since the bed so close to ceiling, a small child would have had difficulty moving around. The neighbourhood itself was good in that it was very close to the Jacob Javitz centre but that alone should not be the reason anyone stays there.  Better to pay more money and not have to endure all the hassles that came with renting this place.  Madison was helpful and responsive, but if all these troubles had not arisen, he would not have needed to be involved in having to help and respond in the first place.  I honestly think he should not rent this place for more than $50/night.  At least then people would get a hint of what they were in for, and get 'their money's worth'.  At the $122/night I paid plus fees for  'cleaning' (and it was NOT clean) - I feel ripped off and would not want someone going through what I went through.  My daughter has had the opposite experience with Airbnb in terms of great value for the money. Airbnb should vet their 'landlord's' accommodation/advertising/pricing for more consistency in genuine representation of product.\\r\\n\",\n",

J'ai tout désinfecté avant d'y aller, mais n'ai pas mis les pieds dans la douche!

Aller chercher la clé de l'immeuble ailleurs n'était aussi pas un plaisir. Je ne reviendrai pas, ni ne recommanderai cette chambre à quiconque. J'aurais dû payer l'hôtel. Je ne savais pas quoi faire avec la clé de l'immeuble, je l'ai donc laissée dans ma chambre après l'avoir verrouillée.

       " \"Overall our experience of NY was awesome, but we felt the issues we had with the room did tarnish it a little. As for location, this place cannot be beat. 10 mins to Times Square, and a great base for exploring the city. It's secure and although the street/neighborhood looks a bit suss, it's not, that's just NY. My main issues were that there were 2 of us and the sleeping arrangements aren't suitable for 2. Sure there is a loft bed (which even though it is stated as a twin, is only meant for one) and the 'bonus futon' that is actually meant to sleep the second person (so not a bonus really, just the second bed) is just way too hard and uncomfortable to suffice. It's not a full size futon as described (it folds to the same width as the single loft bed) and doesn't completely fold down in the space provided for it. Madison told me to move it length ways in the room but it doesn't fit as the fixed ladder for the loft bed and the other furniture takes up too much space to do so. We made do and I removed the foam topper off the loft bed to put onto the futon so it was bearable for my partner to sleep on. Problem was that there were some nasty stains on it that looked like blood. Not good. Also we only had one blanket and two seperate beds. Also not good was that the one blanket did have blood stains on it! (& unwashed). As we had arrived from our flight late, I was forced to use it. The hot pipe that others have mentioned burning them has still not been dealt with. I found out that the building has steam heating, so in each room there are pipes running from floor to ceiling that have a valve at the top which periodically let's out steam. The valve in room 1 is broken as it let's out way too much steam (compared to the pipes in the rest of the apartment which are nearly silent) is very loud and therefore the pipe it's attached to becomes extremely hot(the other pipes get warm to the touch). It is stationed at the end of the loft bed (and therefore the futon also) and you WILL be burnt throughout the night if you touch it. When I spoke to Madison about this he seemed surprised and was unsure of how I was getting burnt even though it's quite obvious that others have brought this to his attention. He assured me that the bedding and pipe issues were going to be addressed the next day but they weren't. I finally received clean bedding a day after that, but the burnt feet issue still wasn't fixed by the time we left. The last issue I had was the cleanliness of the property. The housekeeper had visited the morning of check in but the place was pretty dirty....\",\n",

Shower had soot (or black specks of something) covering the tub floor (was going to take a picture but no time for that); was gross and took 10 minutes to clean.

Also, I know 5th floor walkups are a New York standard, but it's trying.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother positive, though: I was bushed after a long day including an emergency landing of my flight and then convention parties.

Due to that, be prepared that it may get quite hot inside, even if you open the window.\\r\\nFinally, on our last day we killed a cockroach in the room, which was not a pleasant feeling. \",\n",

Second, if I am to be honest (and this is just to help Madison improve things), I would not descibe the room as \"cozy\", at all. It was functional and rather spartan (the wood ladder could be improved a bit). There were no extra sheets for the sofa bed (which I had enquired about using as I was traveling with my teenage son). I found a flat sheet and a comforter in the closet but those were obviously intended for the loft bed which, when we arrived, had only the fitted sheet on it. I therefore had to put the flat sheet and the comforter on the sofa bed so my son could sleep there, and I ended up sleeping with neither a top sheet nor a comforter. There was no soap (not even hand soap) or bath products in the bathroom. We only slept there a few hours as we only had one night in NYC but I feel the end price of 110 euros (59 for the room, and 36 for housecleaning and 15 for \"service\") a bit steep. 59 euros would have been more appropriate.

Be aware that this room is located on the 5th floor, with no elevator. That can serve as a built-in stair-stepper instead of going to a gym. The area is very quiet. Full kitchen is available, but I did not use it. Room has a 'steam valve', which can be noisy, but it only was on for short periods. Be aware that the bed is a 'loft bed', so it will be like going to summer camp, with being on the top bunk. It would be very snug for 2 people, as it is about the size of a twin mattress. The mattress was very comfortable. Be sure to avoid going to bed drunk or stoned, because if you have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, the ladder could be tricky. Hope your insurance would cover that sort of thing. Could not located a hair dryer, but I am sure Madison will find it for next visit. Madison was very quick to respond to my initial question.

It's a fifth floor walk-up. My room was simple with a loft bed, which was kind of fun climbing up into each night - reminded me of being a kid again. There was also a small couch beneath the loft bed that laid down flat to make another bed, if needed. While it was basic and simple, Madison included amenities like a TV and cable box in this room (I assume also in the others), an iron, a small fridge, and the great wi-fi. The commons area was tidy with a kitchen available and cable TV. My room had no view, perhaps the other 3 or 4 rooms did, I don't know, but a view wasn't needed.

There is an air conditioner in the room however since there is a loft bed, it can get hot at night since heat generally rises. Also, the bathroom sinks get hot during the day however I believe that's just due to the hot summer weather. Other than that I really enjoyed my stay and Madison was GREAT with communication.

L’hôte ne vous préviens que 24h qu’il faut aller récupérer les clés à un endroit, puis aller à une autre adresse différente. Ensuite elle vous dit que si les voisins vous posent des questions il ne faut pas mentionner airbnb, que vous venez voir une amie appelé Roxanna idem si des inspecteurs passent. Tout ça n’est pas clair et donc pas rassurant surtout quand on vient d’un autre pays. Le frigo est vide, pareil pour les placards il n’y a rien pour prendre le petit déjeuner à part le café mais même pas un sachet de sucre ou de couverts. Le ménage n’est fait qu’en surface, toute la saleté est caché sous le lit, on comprend pourquoi il y a des cafards.

On entend la chasse d’eau des voisins, on les entend rentrer et sortir de chez eux et on entend les personnes qui parlent dehors. Bref énormément de désagréments nous avons été très très déçu, l’appartement n’est pas à la hauteur de ce que l’offre met en avant et trop cher pour ce qu’il propose autant dire rien.

Because the bathroom is a bit uneven the shower curtain falls in on you. Towels are small and you only get 4. STEPS Don't be fooled, this apartment is not for the unfit. The stairs are steep, narrow and a bit slanted. Let's say they have character. I would not have been able to carry a full size suitcase up. All said and done, the price is GREAT, the location AMAZING and the apartment CLEAN. It was perfect for our needs. Pack some trash bags, a roll of papertowels, and pack light. Also note the owner was completely inflexible on check in check out times and would not provide a 2nd set of keys. Told us we could make one at our own expense but that we would have to turn them in.

       " \"This Airbnb is in a historic tenement building surrounded by modern hotels. The lodging was up a 4 floor walkup with a narrow leaning staircase. The building has definitely seen better days. It was very clean on arrival, but due to some mixup not enough linens were provided for all guests. After messaging the owner, additional towels and blankets were provided. Then we realized additional  sheets were not included in the new linens, we rooted around in the apartment and found an extra sheet for the final bed stashed in a bag in the single closet. The pictures for this place make it appear much larger than it is. So don't expect much more than 250 sq feet divided into 4 rooms. It is very quiet in the building. Be careful with the hot water in the shower as it is somewhat unpredictable and can go from lukewarm to scalding without changing the dials. One note: we were told that a luggage storage business was located on the second floor and made plans around that, it was not available for whatever reason the day we checked out. We had to make shift at the last moment. We had already checked out (locked keys in apartment) at this point, and the offered later checkout by the owner couldn't be used. Overall owner was very responsive to messages, and we enjoyed our stay in New York.\",\n",

I messaged Morgan through the Airbnb app to ask if we could check in a little early, but received no response. It wasn’t a huge issue so I didn’t feel the need to follow up with a phone call. \\n\\nJust beware this is very bare bones and we almost turned around and left just as soon as we arrived; I wish I could post the pictures that I took. The building is run down, there is no door handle on the front door to the apartment so closing the door and locking the deadbolt is a pain, the apartment itself did not seem like there was much effort put into its’ appearance (smudges all over the walls and floor, broken poster frame, a dirty mop/ladder/cleaning supplies left out in the corner, no paper towels, etc.) and it smelled nauseatingly strongly of Febreeze.\\n\\nThe window in the main bedroom does not close or lock due to the AC unit; there is a gap between the window and the AC unit which lets in all of the noise from the street and is a safety issue as there is a fire escape right next to it. Again, the neighborhood seemed safe enough but I was uncomfortable with an open window.\\n\\nThe AC unit is loud and pops on and off, so between that and the cracked window to let in all of the street noise (there was construction going on in the street directly out front) we got zero sleep. The bed was comfortable, fresh towels and extra sheets were provided, and the main bedroom got a lot of natural light, so there are pros.\\n\\nThe shower (which has very light water pressure) has windows in it and only one is frosted, so I was uneasy taking a shower as people can see in if they are on that side of the building.\\n\\nOverall, if none of these things are an issue to you then it’s a decent value to stay in a convenient location close to the city.

       " \"il a été facile de contacter Stéphanie avant le séjour (disponible et rapide). nous n'avons pas eu besoin de la joindre une fois sur place car tout était clair. le logement correspond à la description, il est bien situé (métro, Times Square, restauration). 2 bémols : les travaux à proximité et la chaleur dans la chambre malgré le ventilateur.\",\n",
       " 'The place is nice and clean. Walking distance to time square. The room had a good size. It fitted 3 people with their suitcases. The bathroom was a bit small. The apartment is on the 5th floor and there is no elevator. Stephanie answered quickly and gave clear instuctions for everything! It was a very nice experience!!',\n",
       " 'Una excelente ubicación, nos sentimos seguras, fui con mi hija. Cansada eso sí de subir5 pisos luego de caminar todo el día. Stephanie es amable y siempre dispuesta a ayudar.',\n",
       " 'The location of this place is really great and the check-in was really easy and luckily we could leave our luggage before and after check-in, appreciated! \\nIn general it is a nice but small place. Totally fine for like a night but otherwise it gets a bit small for more than one person, in my opinion. \\nWe enjoyed staying here, only think it is a but pricey for the small and easy place, on the other side I guess that’s just NYC \\u200d♀️',\n",
       " 'Great location! Check out midtown (liberty) bagel on 35th st. There is no AC so use the fan!!! Comfy bed. Pack lightly, it’s a 5th floor walk up (ie no elevator). Great communication and let me drop my bags/leave my bags late which saved me carrying it all over before my 9pm departure. Great stay.',\n",
       " 'The room we rented was great. We had the bigger room and that was really great for us. However, the fan never really helped us cool the room down. It was extremely warm and humid at night an during the day. The bathroom was much smaller than expected. I’m 5’2ft tall and I was still struggling to move in the bathroom and the shower. It is very well located, everything is walk distance reachable and the area is safe. Would not recommend for family with a stroller since the apartment is located on the fifth floor and the stairs are horrible to climb.',\n",
       " 'Очень милое и живописное место в центре Нью-Йорка. Находясь у Stephanie я почувствовал себя практически жителем этого города. Да, действительно, лестница на 5 этаж сравнительно узка, но ... это, наоборот, добавляет колорита этой квартире. \\nОколо дома Stephanie мы нашли хорошее место для завтрка и всего за 15 минут добрались до остановки мегабаса. \\nРекомендую для других (как минимум, молодых) путешественников! ',\n",
       " 'Great location! Close to a grocery store, lots of food places, easy access to the subway and taxis. Loved it!',\n",
       " 'Abrir la ventana porque hace mucho calor, y falta más comida',\n",
       " 'Great location (8min walk off the nearest Subway station), good amenities and good communication with host, was able to accept a last minute change adding one more person to the room. Downsides: 5 floors of very steep stairs, no elevator, very small bathroom that was not kept very clean and a minor issue with the gas kitchen where the other guests left it on. ',\n",
       " 'Unfortunately we did not have a pleasant experience staying here. We had made arrangements with our host 6 months prior to our trip to be able to check in early and rest up from our red eye flight and have a place to store our luggage for our 1st day, I tried reconfirming the arrangements a week before our trip and did not get a response from our host until less than 24 hours before our flight to be told there was a \"glitch in the system\" (that AirBnb was unable to confirm) that allowed someone else to book the room she had said she would block for us,  so suddenly we were unable to check in early and had no other options for storing our luggage or resting up. Our host offered to store our luggage at a nearby hotel to which she said she would pay for, but upon arriving at the hotel I found out it was only going to be stored with her parents in the hotel room that they were currently staying at. To top it off while in their possession they told me water spilt out of something, everything was wet and books and electronics were ruined... which would not have happened had we been able to check in early and leave our stuff in the room. Once we did make it back to the Airbnb we were met by our host and her parents only to be locked out of the apartment and still unable to check in after 5 PM when regular check in was 4. It was a very frustrating process and not one I would ever want to repeat so I would not stay here again.',\n",
       " \"Stephanie had such a wonderful little room for us!! It was perfect for my sister and me to be able to drop off things in between sight seeing and traveling. The 5 flights of stairs were a little bit exhausting in the heat, but the apartment was nice and air conditioned! The location was perfect- the apartment is only a couple blocks from Times Square as well as the bus station that we used to travel into the city, and several subway lines. Stephanie was so accommodating to our early arrival and late departure which took the stress off of carrying our bags around with us everywhere. Definitely check out 2 Bros. Pizza, it's right down the block! It was a reallt convenient and cheap but delicious little pizza stop. The room was comfy and, for the price, was just what we needed for our one night stay in the city!! Thank you Stephanie!\",\n",
       " 'Very pleasant place and nice host ! Tks  !',\n",
       " 'Great place near times square! I would totally recommend it !',\n",
       " 'An overall good experience!',\n",
       " 'Great place to stay if you want a simple and true NYC experience. Good instructions are given on how to get into this inner city apartment. A subway station to Central Park is only a block away and Times Square is about 2 blocks away. It’s a bit gritty but the place is cleaned everyday to get you ready for the stay.',\n",
       " 'Great location & Irish pub directly below apt, easy check in and superb communication! ',\n",
